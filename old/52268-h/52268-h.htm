<h2><a name="A_BOYS_RACE_WITH_GENERAL" id="A_BOYS_RACE_WITH_GENERAL">A BOY’S RACE WITH GENERAL
GRANT AT EPHESUS.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Turkish battery ashore thundered a royal
salute to General Grant as the <i>Vandalia</i> which
bore him from port to port in the Mediterranean
steamed up to her anchorage in the harbor of
Smyrna. Thirty great iron-clads followed in quick
succession; men-of-war crowded the harbor. They
had been ordered into Turkish waters on account of
the war then raging between Turkey and Russia.
From ship and shore thousands of spectators watched
the <i>Vandalia’s</i> approach with eager interest, and
from the foremast of every vessel and the flagstaffs
of the city the American flag waved the General a
glad and hearty welcome.</p>

<p>No one in all the city was more pleased at his
arrival than Fred Martin, the son of an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
merchant resident in Smyrna. He stood with the
crowd upon the quay cheering enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Fred had sailed with his mother from New York
when he was but three years old, and his memories
of his native land were consequently vague and fanciful.
His playmates were the little Greek and Armenian
boys of his neighborhood, and the few
English children belonging to the British consulate.
He had told his comrades, in glowing words, the history
of General Grant. Fred was very precocious,
and had learned several languages. In his play with
the Greek boys he had learned to speak Greek, and
in the same pleasant way the Armenian boys had
taught him their language. Besides, in the streets
and bazaars he had picked up Turkish and Arabic
enough to converse quite easily with the merchants
speaking those languages. So great was Fred’s proficiency
that at home he went by the name of “the
little polyglot.”</p>

<p>The boys shouted and cheered till they found that
General Grant would not come ashore that day, and
gradually they departed for their homes. We will
leave General Grant to receive the official courtesies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of the authorities of the city and the admirals and
captains of the fleet, and proceed with Master
Fred.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 557px;">
<img src="images/i-006.jpg" width="557" height="337" alt="crowd of pepole and a horse" />
<div class="caption">WHERE THE PONY CAME FROM.</div>
</div>

<p>Fred was the owner of a beautiful little Arabian
horse, which made him the envy of every boy of his
acquaintance. This horse was the Christmas gift of
his father. Christmas eve he had been secretly led
to Mr. Martin’s stable, that in the morning Fred
might receive a happy surprise. Early Christmas
morning Fred was sent to the stable on some trifling
errand, and what was his astonishment to see a new
horse quietly munching his breakfast. His delight
knew no bounds when he found a blue ribbon tied
around the pony’s neck (for Fred at once called him
a pony), to which was attached a card, on which was
written:</p>

<p>“Fred Martin. From his affectionate father, Christmas,
1877.”</p>

<p>The pony had been purchased from an Arab.
This Arab with his little family had wandered far
from his own country, and at length had settled in the
environs of Smyrna. Through sickness and poverty
he was compelled to part with his beautiful horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his children crying bitterly, and fondly caressing him,
as he was led away from the tent.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin’s conscience almost smote him as he
witnessed this poor family’s grief; but the Arab
motioned to him to hasten away, signifying that the
children would soon forget their sorrow.</p>

<p>The pony, as he was called, was of the purest
Arabian blood. He was so gentle that Fred’s little
sisters ran into his stall and played without hesitation
around his feet. Yet he had all the metal and
fire of his royal race. In color he was milk-white,
and his neck arched like the curve of an ivory bow.
His head was small and elegant; so perfect, indeed,
that an artist had taken it as a model for a handsome
ideal Arabian in a fine picture he was painting. The
pony’s ears were satin-like, and responded to the
slightest impression with a quick, tremulous movement
that betokened the keenest intelligence. His
eyes beamed with affection and loyalty. Ladies delighted
to run their fingers through his soft, silken
hair; and they loved to pet him as he held his nose
to them to be stroked, as they would a beautiful
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Fred had read the lives of Alexander the Great and
Sir Walter Scott. He had been charmed by the allusions
to their fondness for riding and hunting in their
boyhood days, and he emulated them in many a gallop
and chase among the hills surrounding the city.
Many a hare and partridge had he run down and shot,
and brought home in triumph hanging to the pommel
of his saddle. Many a time he had startled the shepherds
and frightened their sheep by dashing upon
them around some sharp curve, for which misdemeanor
he had to put spurs to the pony to escape the
shepherds’ wrath. Besides, he had ridden to many
places which travellers go thousands of miles to see.
He could point out the different layers in the walls of
the old castle overlooking the city, which was first built
by Alexander the Great, and last by the Saracens. He
could guide travellers to the beautiful ruins of an
ancient temple erected to Homer; and several times
he had ridden into the very cave where many scholars
believe the great poet Homer at one time lived.
These excursions were attended by many dangers, but
somehow Fred came out of them unharmed.</p>

<p>After General Grant had been several days in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Smyrna, Fred was overjoyed at receiving an invitation
to accompany him on a grand excursion to the ruined
city of Ephesus, lying fifty miles from Smyrna. His
father told him that he might take the pony with him,
as several freight-cars were to be filled with horses
and donkeys for the use of the party. The Pasha—the
governor of that district of Turkey—had arranged
for this excursion as his greatest compliment to General
Grant. He chartered a large train; ordered a
mounted body-guard of Turkish officers to proceed to
Ephesus, and a regiment of troops to receive the General
at the depot with military honors. The party
needed a strong military escort, for at Ephesus there
are robbers who live in caves, and watch for distinguished
visitors, whom they sometimes capture, and
demand a heavy ransom for their release.</p>

<p>Fred galloped early to the depot. He kept the
pony quiet amid the general confusion, with extreme
difficulty. The donkey drivers were mercilessly
pounding the donkeys, and yelling at them, to get
them into the car; the grooms were struggling with
the restive horses; dogs were yelping; the soldiers
were going through their exercises, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
was a bewildering medley of unpleasant sounds.</p>

<p>By much persistence Fred got the pony into a car
with a fine gray horse and a snow-white mule sent
from the Pasha’s stables for General and Mrs. Grant.
Fred was almost wonder-struck at the sight of these
beautiful animals. The horse was dressed in gorgeous
housings. The saddle was heavily embroidered
and plated with gold; even the buckles and rings were
of gold, and a rich gold filigree work covered the bridle
and portions of the reins and girths. Fred had heard of
the richness of Oriental accoutrements, but he was not
prepared for such magnificence as this. The mule was
not dressed so regally, but being regarded a sacred
animal by the Pasha, a queen could not have desired
a greater compliment than was offered Mrs. Grant in
the sending of this mule for her use.</p>

<p>When the General arrived, all things were ready,
and the train swept out into an enchanting valley.
Past Turkish villages it ran, the little Turkish boys,
like many boys in more civilized countries, giving it a
vigorous salute with pebbles as it hurried on. Often
it passed trains of camels making their tedious way
to bordering countries, and occasionally a hunter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
his dogs would seem to start out of a jungle or hill-side,
as if on purpose to delight Master Fred.</p>

<p>In an hour’s time the train thundered over the
river Cayster and shot into the depot at Ayasolook.
Instantly all was confusion again. The horses and
donkeys were hustled out of the cars. The horses
were arranged in cavalry line, and the donkeys were
drawn up in the rear. General Grant gave the signal
to mount, and the men of the party instantly vaulted
into the saddle. The white mule had been behaving
strangely for an animal of his reputation, and Mrs.
Grant was advised not to undertake to ride him. She
wisely listened to advice, for the mule turned out on
this particular occasion to be very careless with his
heels, and to have a very abrupt way of stopping,
which obliged his rider to travel on a short distance
alone. Mrs. Grant had been so well acquainted with
mules in the West that she had in fact no confidence
even in a sacred mule. By some means she with the
other ladies got the smallest and most tired-looking
donkeys. Now they put spurs to their horses, leaving
the donkeys with their unfortunate riders far behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment only they stop to look at the few
pieces of glittering marble which are all that remain
of the snowy blocks and columns of the once glorious
temple of Diana. They decide to skirt the plain lying
between Ayasolook and Ephesus, by riding along
an ancient breakwater; they pause for an instant to
listen to the rustle of the long grass against the wall
where once was heard the ebb and flow of the sea.
Up they climb among a whole cluster of temples,
stopping only to look at the face of a shattered statue,
or at a beautiful carved hand extended almost beseechingly
from a heap of rubbish. The horses
stumble through public squares, regaining solid
footing for an instant on some broad pedestal of a
once world-renowned monument. Now Fred’s pony
flounders in the basin of an old fountain, into which
he has been forced to leap. The ruins seem to rise
up in waves, and they are obliged to dismount and
lead their horses up to the great theatre, where they
halt for rest and lunch.</p>

<p>Fred tied the pony to the foot of a prostrate
Apollo and slipped away to explore this great building
for himself. He climbed to the top of the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
on the side of which the theatre was built, and
looked in wonder upon the stage far below. This
great interior contained seats for 50,000 people.
Fred fancied he could almost hear the thunder of
applause from distant ages, like the far-away roar of
the sea. He now clambered down to look at the
foundations of the building. The great pillars and
arches stood as firmly as the day on which they were
completed. St. Paul had looked upon the same
grand architecture that he now beheld.</p>

<p>As he looked he began to stir the earth carelessly
with his whip-handle. Suddenly he brought a curious
object to the surface, which he picked up and carefully
examined. With his knife he dug away the
erosion, and saw by the glitter underneath that the
object was of gold. In other places something which
he could not cut resisted his knife. It now occurred to
him that he had found a bracelet, and he hastened to
the company with his treasure. An antiquarian in
the party, upon close examination, found that Fred
had unearthed what had been a very costly bracelet.
It was of rare design, and set all around with precious
stones; doubtless it had glittered many times upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the fair arm of some ancient performer. All were delighted
at Fred’s discovery, and felt that this little
<i>souvenir</i> in itself would make the day memorable.
In a short time they had visited the market-place, the
stadium—a building which held 76,000 people—the
odeon, or music hall, and the cave of the Seven Sleepers,
and were ready to start back.</p>

<p>As several conjectured, on their return General
Grant proposed a grand race. Lying between them
and the depot was a smooth plain three miles in extent.
On the further side a leaning column could be
seen, which was at once selected as the reaching-post.
A Turkish officer was chosen umpire and sent on in
advance. General Grant had noticed Fred’s pony
many times during the day, and was greatly pleased
with his exquisite beauty. He thought it possible
that the pony might be the sharpest competitor his
own elegant, high-spirited gray would have in the
race, and he beckoned Fred to take a position at his
side. The starting-point was to be an immense sarcophagus,
in which a noble Greek had once been
buried, but which now, from some cause, lay upturned
on the edge of the plain. At this place ten superbly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
mounted horsemen drew up in line, with General
Grant and Fred on the right.</p>

<p>The English consul gave the signal for starting.</p>

<p>Fred shook the reins upon the pony’s neck, and he
bounded forward as gracefully as a deer. The pony
instinctively prepared himself for the race. Both
horses were of princely pedigree and showed their blood
in the sylph-like ease with which they moved. Fred
knew that in horsemanship the odds must be greatly
in favor of General Grant. How Fred admired him
as he sat upon the gray, every inch the general; and
he felt almost alarmed at the thought of contesting
the race with such a splendid horseman! But he
quickly made up his mind to compete for the honors
as sharply as he could. His light weight he knew to
be in his favor, and he had all confidence in the
pony’s speed and courage; even then he could feel
him tremble under his growing excitement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px;">
<img src="images/i-018.jpg" width="546" height="332" alt="the race" />
<div class="caption">NEITHER THE GENERAL NOR FRED SEEMED TO GAIN AN INCH!</div>
</div>

<p>They all had made an even start, and for many rods
had kept together; but now Fred and the General
began to push ahead. The pony’s silken tail
brushed the shoulder of the foremost horse, while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
handsome mane tossed against the bridle-rein of his
antagonist.</p>

<p>It was a fine sight to see these two beautiful horses
settle down for the remaining two-mile run. The
movement of each was perfect. There was no convulsive
effort, no waste of energy. They glided onward
as smoothly as the flight of birds. Nose to nose,
neck to neck, shoulder to shoulder they flew. Neither
the General nor Fred seemed to gain an inch, and
neither seemed to care whether the other won or not.
Patches of meadow grass brilliant with wild flowers,
pieces of rich sculpture, a thousand rare objects that
once shone in beautiful houses or more beautiful temples,
lay scattered along their course; but they were
unnoticed in the glorious speed.</p>

<p>But a half-mile remains, and each horse is making
his best time. The sun lights up horses and riders,
so that they seem like phantoms sweeping over the
plain. Now with a bound they cross a wide ditch,
the General’s horse distancing the pony by several
feet. The pony clings to him like a shadow. One
touch of the spur upon his hot flank, and he recovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
his lost ground. Never was there so close a race
before! Now it is whip and spur, words of command
and words of encouragement, and the horses seem
scarcely to touch the ground. Now the General
leads, now Fred. The goal is reached!</p>

<p>The umpire did not decide.</p>

<p>Fred told the Greek boy that night that he won it.
If you are anxious to know who did win, ask the
General.</p>

<h2><a name="INDIAN_CHILDREN_AND" id="INDIAN_CHILDREN_AND">INDIAN CHILDREN AND

<p class="drop-cap">MANY people suppose that the Indian children
have no dolls or pets.</p>

<p>This is a mistake. The Indian baby, or pappoose,
is provided by its squaw-mother with a sort of doll
from its earliest infancy.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/i-023.jpg" width="325" height="350" alt="two little girls" />
<div class="caption">LITTLE INDIAN GIRLS AND THEIR “PAPPOOSES.”</div>
</div>
<p>The baby itself is tied to a board which is covered
with buckskins and fanciful bindings, or with bright-colored
cloth ornamented with bead-work and tinsel.
This baby-board, which is carriage and cradle in one,
looks like the toe of a large slipper, and has a piece
of wood bent across the head to protect its little copper-colored
occupant from being struck by anything.
Just as her convenience may prompt, the squaw hangs
her pappoose, thus cradled, on her back while walking,
or in a tree when working about the tent, or on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the saddle pommel as represented in the picture.
From the protecting headboard hangs suspended the
doll composed of feathers, beads and red cloth, perhaps
representing an Indian warrior. The little pappoose
looks at this dangling image all day long, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
this monotonous endeavor often causes a horrible
squint from which the little Indian never recovers.</p>



<p>The squaw-mothers sometimes make miniature
pappooses, bound to cradle-boards in fancy covering,
like their own, for the older children to play with;
but it is a still commoner sight to see the girls carrying
a puppy in a little blanket over their shoulders.
It seems strange that they should make of their pets
what is considered the greatest delicacy, puppy-stew,
which is the chief dish of a feast given in commemoration
of a child having become a certain age.</p>

<div class="caption">LITTLE INDIAN GIRLS AND THEIR PETS.</div>
</div>
<p>The little Indians also make pets of crows. A little
girl will often daily carry about with her a wicker
basket filled with baby crows just as they are taken
from the nest by her brother. Beside her an old dog
will often be wiled along, dragging her puppies in a
similar net or basket stretched across transverse poles.</p>



<p>The Indian boys have pet colts to ride; and they
make pets of young eagles, which they put on a sort
of stand with a string attached to one leg to prevent
the birds from flying away.</p>

<p>The boys also early learn to use the bow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
arrows, and are often occupied in driving blackbirds
and cowbirds from the growing maize.</p>

<div class="caption">AN “INDIAN MEAL.”</div>
</div>

<p>Corn is the only vegetable cultivated by the Indian,
and the Chippewas, who are semi-civilized, grind
their corn into a sort of coarse samp by pounding it
in a mortar with a wooden pestle. They also roast
the ears, and dry it for winter use. Great groups of
children will sit with a squaw (perhaps mending moccasins)
to help them at their work and preserve order,
on high platforms the whole day, overlooking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
corn-fields, so as to drive away the birds as they
alight in flocks. Picture No. 3 represents a group
at a little “Indian meal,” which plays both ways—as
it is Indian meal they are feasting on. The lodges,
or tepees, in the background are peculiar to the
Chippewa tribe, being made of birch bark wrapped
around poles.</p>

<div class="caption">INDIAN BABY AND DOLL.</div>
</div>

<p>The older boys amuse themselves by different
games while tending the horses, one of which is represented.
First they spread upon the ground a buffalo
hide on which they kneel facing each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Then one takes a little stick and passes it from one
hand to the other, first behind and then before, while
the other boy guesses which hand it is in. He is entitled
to three guesses. The first, if right, counts
him three; the second, two; and the third, one. If
he misses altogether, he loses according to the number
put up for stake. The one guessing designates
his guess by hitting his right or left shoulder, according
to the hand he thinks his opponent holds it
in.</p>

<p>This, like all other Indian games, is made interesting
by the stakes, which generally consist of some
ornament, or some service to be rendered.</p>

<h2><a name="RIGA_IN_THE_CHIMNEY" id="RIGA_IN_THE_CHIMNEY">RIGA IN THE CHIMNEY.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HOW did Riga get into the chimney?</p>

<p>Well, if the truth must be told, it was not
merely a chimney, but the window; and not a window
only, but the front door; and not only the front
door, but the staircase. It was, in fact, so much of
all four, that it was but slightly like any one of them.
Things were altogether upside-down in this house.
Instead of being built on the ground like all reasonable
houses, it was under it; and although it had but
one place to come in at, and but one fire to cook at,
so many people lived inside of it in tents of their own
that it was in reality a village; and yet again, it was
a village where you had only to lift the skin wall of
your one-roomed dwelling to get into your neighbor’s.</p>

<p>The land was Kamschatka, and Riga was a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
boy of that cold country. He had been outside to
get some milk from the deer, and had come to the
hole that formed the entrance, and taken the first
step down on the notched pole that was to land him
in the fire if he didn’t take a good leap over when
he got to the bottom.</p>

<p>It was already dark. Above him one of the dogs—there
were twenty or thirty in all—got a smell of
the milk, or a smell of a pot on the fire; and as he
sniffed greedily through chimney (we might as
well call it that), he lost his balance and came
tumbling head and heels over Riga with a prodigious
racket and howling into the village below. Riga,
who was fat, thought he was going too; but he clung
to the notched pole till he had his senses again, and
then he clung the tighter because of something
else.</p>

<p>At the foot of the pole burned a fire of moss which
gave much heat, little light, and more smoke than
anything else; this smoke hung duskily around the
chimney, and went out lazily as it happened to feel inclined.
Riga’s entrance had been covered by the dog’s
fall, the smoke and dust hid him effectually, and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
stopped him from coming down. It was a little
whisper which, although addressed to a person
close by the whisperer’s side, scaled the pole for the
benefit of Riga’s curious ears.</p>

<p>“Hush! some one came in.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, for no one comes down.”</p>

<p>“Some one is listening, then.”</p>

<p>“Lopka, you suspect everything. Who would stop
up there, and why? and who would know there was
anything to listen to?”</p>

<p>Riga was listening, however; and although his
position was most uncomfortable, his curiosity was so
excited by hearing a conversation which was not intended
for any one to hear, that he bent his ears
more eagerly than ever, and was as silent as a snowflake.</p>

<p>“When can it be done?” whispered Lopka
shrilly.</p>

<p>“When all are asleep.”</p>

<p>“We may be asleep too.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that.”</p>

<p>“Can we get out without rousing the sleepers?
Do you think the herd will be quiet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have no one to fear but the curious Riga;
that boy always has one ear open.”</p>

<p>“That is so;” thought Riga in the chimney, “and
now I see the wisdom of it.” He gave a movement
of satisfaction, and some of the milk splashed hissing
down into the fire.</p>

<p>“What is that, Svorovitch?” asked Lopka.</p>

<p>“I have often heard that sound in the fire,” was
the reply, “and my father says if it is a saint’s day,
the saint weeps for some wrong done.”</p>

<p>At this moment the thick pungent smoke tickled
Riga’s nose, and he gave vent to three good hearty
sneezes. The two boys below jumped to their feet
and ran away.</p>

<p>“There is still more, and it may be learned by
listening,” murmured Riga as he went down. “I am
not a saint, but I will do more than weep if any
wrong is about to be done.”</p>

<p>It was the winter time; the cold was intense. If
you should put your uncovered face out of doors, the
eyelashes would freeze to your cheeks. The weather
was so fierce, the clouds so threatening, that but
few of the men had ventured out; such as had, rode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
up swiftly on their sledges at nightfall, set the deer
free among the herd, and gathered round the
fire to sleep, or talk over the adventures of the day.</p>

<p>Among other things, this bitterest night of all, they
returned to the conversation of several preceding
nights, about two Englishmen with their guide, belated
by the snows of an early winter. These travellers
had pressed on towards a port on the coast,
thinking to winter there comfortably until some ship
would sail for San Francisco; but reports had now
reached the tribe of a fatal accident to one of the
reindeer; and wise Lodovin shook his head. He
was seventy years old, and knew everything.</p>

<p>“There was a spot,” he said, “near the Kamschatkan
shore, a hut underground constructed from
a wrecked vessel by some sailors. All guides know
of this place. There was fuel there, and they would
not freeze; but they could have had no provisions
worth speaking of, and either they must die of starvation,
or go on and perish in the coming storm upon
the toondra.”</p>

<p>This had been repeated each night since Lodovin
had heard of the dead deer; but his listeners were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
willing to receive an observation many times for
want of fresher.</p>

<p>Usually Riga sat long in the midst of the circle;
but to-night he withdrew early to his particular home,
a small enclosure a few feet square, where the whole
family slept, lighted by a bit of moss floating in oil.
He had seen Lopka enter the next room; and the
fear of missing him brought him early to lie on his
own floor where he could peep beneath the edge of the
skin. Later, when everything was quiet, the same
anxiety made him crawl out and take up his old
place on the notched pole, where he clung silent and
immovable, but listening and looking intently, every
sense merged into his sense of curiosity.</p>

<p>Ah, woe to Riga in the chimney! two quiet figures
suddenly came straight to the pole, and one began
to mount. To mount? Yes; and seeing Riga, to
seize him by the foot and sternly bid him be silent
and go out.</p>

<p>In spite of his sturdy saintship, the surprised Riga
was frightened to death by the knife in Svorovitch’s
hand; and not daring to disobey, he tremblingly did
as he was told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>He was speedily followed by Lopka and Svorovitch.
Holding him well, and forcing him to assist them,
the youths fastened to a sled three of the best and
fleetest deer of the herd, which Riga very well knew
did not belong to them. That done, they paid no
attention to his entreaties, but taking him with them
in the sled, the long, steady pace of the deer soon
left their home behind them.</p>

<p>Riga now began to cry and beg them to spare his
life. “You are going to cut my throat and bury me
in the toondra,” he said. “You had better not, or I
will do you some harm as soon as I am a saint.”</p>

<p>Svorovitch burst into a loud laugh. “Cut your
throat!” he said; “child, the tempest and the cold
may kill you, but we shan’t. No, you might be safe
this minute if we could have trusted you to go back
and be quiet. But we know you would have waked
the whole tribe to ask questions of what we were
about, and they would have followed us.”</p>

<p>From what Lopka and Svorovitch spoke of after
this, Riga learned they were bound on a journey to
some distant point and were racing to reach it
against the storm. Further than that he learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
nothing, for he was too sleepy now to be inquisitive
and, carefully sheltered by his companions, he soon
lost all consciousness of even his own fat little
person.</p>

<p>An Arctic winter storm on the great toondra—do
you know what that means? Fancy three of the
worst snow-storms that ever you have seen, taking
place at one and the same time, the fierce, icy bitter
wind roaring and sweeping with terrible force across
an endless plain, the air blinding, sight impossible,
and you will know why Lopka and Svorovitch, and
even Riga, gazed often and anxiously at the clouds
throughout the following day. With eyes and ears
always on the alert, and well on the alert at that, our
little saint thought he heard now and then strange
sounds of great distant winds nearing them, and at
last he began to discover, as he peered upwards, the
thick look in the air that tells that snow is on the
way.</p>

<p>“The wind is rising,” said Riga. “You ought to
take me home;” but though he wished to cry, he
kept his tears back bravely. Suddenly he cried out,
“The storm!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>And it was the storm, the great Arctic storm, coming
all at once, blinding and thick, borne on the
wind, and sweeping over the ground as if it never
meant to stop or rest there.</p>

<p>“We can go no further,” cried Svorovitch. “We,
too, shall be lost!”</p>

<p>“Don’t despair, little brother,” said Lopka, but
at the same time turning away his face.</p>

<p>Here the alert little Riga lifted his fat face to tell
them that he had for some time heard the ocean, and
that just as the snow appeared he had seen a volcano
in the ground: perhaps from these signs they
could tell where they were.</p>

<p>The roaring of the tempest was so terrible that it
was now impossible to distinguish the sound of the
waves; but when Riga was questioned as to his volcano,
and could only answer that he had seen smoke
coming directly from the ground in a certain direction,
Svorovitch exclaimed aloud, and springing out of
the sledge ran a few feet from them. Following the
sound of his voice, Riga and Lopka found him on his
knees with his head bent above a black pipe setting
a little above the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are here,” he cried, “it is the place! They
answer me.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the figure of a man appeared in
the storm, seized upon them, and leading them a few
steps further, descended by a slanting passage into a
snug little under-ground cabin, free of smoke and
passably light, where the boys found themselves face
to face with the two English travellers. Their mutual
explanations, though given with some difficulty,
showed how the guide had stolen off with the remaining
deer and left them to their fate, and that
that morning they had eaten the last of their provisions;
and how the adventurous Lopka and Svorovitch,
pitying their condition, had determined to set
out and save them at any risk. Riga comprehended
what was not explained to the Englishmen—that it
was undertaken in secret, for neither of the boys yet
owned deer of their own, and had no hope of being
successful in borrowing such as they needed. After
all, he had not guessed rightly in the chimney, and
he felt that there is something more to know of
people than what one finds out by eavesdropping.
Things half heard often look wrong: when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
whole is seen they may turn out nobly right.</p>

<p>The gratitude of the travellers to the brave young
Kamschatkans was great; and although the food they
had brought was only dried fish, and some fat of the
whale, it was the best they had, and a heartier and
happier supper was seldom eaten. The storm continued
throughout that night; but clearing off the
next morning, the party were able to start on their
return journey to the village. The deer, who know
their masters, and will seldom desert the place where
they are, were ready to return, and carried them back
at a pace which, although not as fleet as that of a
horse, was more unflagging and reliable. Welcome
from all parties greeted their arrival, no harsh words
met them; the parents were only too glad to have
their brave boys safe again, the owners of the deer
too happy that their property was restored unhurt.
Only the wise Lodovin shook his head.</p>

<p>“If the boys begin like that,” said he, “what do
you suppose the men will do? Take care how you
praise those who respect no man’s property!” For
Lodovin owned one of the deer which the boys had
borrowed. As for fat little Riga, he had gained so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
much glory (you must remember it was he who had
discovered the smoke-pipe) by hanging in the chimney,
that it became his favorite position, to the everlasting
danger of the limbs of the tribe and his own
head, and also to the great confusion of such unwary
beings as weekly told secrets about the village fire.</p>

<h2><a name="SEEING_THE_POPE" id="SEEING_THE_POPE">SEEING THE POPE.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT is only the young people of America who, in this
age of the world, have not been to Europe; therefore
to them and for them I have written down, in
journal form, a few incidents of travel; among them,
a brief account of an evening spent with La Baronessa
Von Stein, and a presentation to the Pope.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i> This evening we have spent, by invitation,
with the Baroness Von Stein, widow of Baron
Von Stein of Germany. The Baroness, a German by
birth, passed much of her youth in Poland. Skilled as
a horsewoman, she often joined her father in rural
pastimes, shooting, hunting etc. Being perfectly well,
and of great mind, she acquired, as do all the noble
women of Europe, a thorough knowledge of the
ancient classics in their originals; also a familiarity
with nearly every spoken language of the Old and
New World. Well comparing with Margaret, Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of Navarre in fluency of tongue, she readily changes
from Italian to French, from French to Spanish
quotes from Buckle, Draper, etc., in English, is quite
at home on German philosophy, notwithstanding her
devotion to the Catholic Church. A singularly attractive
old lady is she now; rather masculine in
manner, exceedingly so, in mind; a fine painter in
oil to whom the Pope has sat, in person, for his portrait.
We have seen the likeness. It is pronounced
perfect. She is very anxious for us to see his Holiness,
and we certainly shall not leave Rome without
so doing. The Baroness has an autograph note from
Pio Nono, which is a rare possession. This she displayed
with far more pride than was apparent upon
showing her own handiwork. When the Holy Father
sat to her, in order to get the true expression, conversation
was necessary and she repeated, with much
satisfaction, snatches therefrom, which were of the
brightest nature. However learned <i>he</i> may be, in the
Baroness Von Stein he meets no inferior.</p>

<p>As we entered her room, she was smoking: she
begged pardon, but continued the performance.</p>

<p>The cigar was a cigar, no cigarette, no white-coated
article, but a long, large, brown Havana, such as
gentlemen in our own country use.</p>

<p>“You will find no difficulty,” said she, between her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
whiffs, “in seeing ‘Il Papa,’ and then you will say
how good is his picture.”</p>

<p>During a part of our interview, there was present a
sister of a “Secretaris Generalissimo to the Pope,”
who told us the manner in which the Popeship will
be filled—she talked only in Italian, but I give a
literal translation. “The new Pope is approved by
the present Pio Nono. His name is written upon
paper by the present Pope and sealed. The document
is seen by no one, till after the death of ‘Il
Papa,’ when it is opened, as a will, by the proper
power. Unlike a will, it can not be disputed.”</p>

<p>Pio Nono certainly had his election in a far different
way, according to the statements of the Roman
Exiles of that day.</p>

<p>As the life of his Majesty hangs upon eternity, the
matter of a successor will soon be decided. “Antonelli
gone, where will it fall!” said I, but at once
perceived that I was trespassing and the subject was
speedily changed.</p>

<p>We left the Baronessa, intent upon one thing, viz.,
a presentation to the Pope, as soon as practical. Our
Consul being no longer accredited to this power, but
to Victor Emanuel, we must apply elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i> Started early this morning, from my
residence corner of Bocca di Leone and Bia di Lapa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
(doubtful protectors), for the American College and
Father Chatard, in order to get a “permit” to the
Monday Reception at the Vatican. On my way
(and those who know Rome as well as we do will
know how much on the way) I took, as I do upon all
occasions, the Roman and Trajan forums, always
walking when practicable; by the above means, I am
likely to become very familiar with these beautiful
views. They are so fascinating that I can not begin
any day’s work without taking these first. The Trajan
is my favorite. It may not be uninteresting to
mention here that, on my circuitous stroll to the said
College, I saw, and halted the better to see, one of
those picturesque groups of Contadini and Contadine
who frequent the towns of Italy. There were, first
the parents, dressed in the fantastic garb of their class
of peasantry, i. e., the mother with the long double
pads, one scarlet and one white, hanging over her
head and neck, while the father wore a gay slouched
hat; then three girls, severally garbed in short pink
dress, blue apron embroidered with every conceivable
color, simple and combined, yellow handkerchief
thrown over the chest, long earrings, heavy braids,
bare-footed or in fancifully knit shoes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="225" height="444" alt="woman" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Roman Contadina.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Two boys in equally remarkable attire, and a baby
that looked like a butterfly, completed the domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
circle. They
did not seem
to mind my
gaze. The
father continued
his smoking,
the mother
her knitting,
the girls
their hooking,
the boys their
listless lounging,
and the
baby its play
in the dust.
There was a
charm in the
scene. One
sight however
(to be sure
mine was an
extended opportunity)
is
sufficient. A
few steps beyond this gathering, I found photographs
colored to represent these vagrants, and at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
store pictures of the very individuals—I purchased
specimens to take to America, a novelty the other
side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>After an hour or two, I reached the American
College, was met by the students who very politely
directed me to the Concièrge, and my name was taken
to the learned Father. The students all wore the
long robe, though speaking English.</p>

<p>Being a Quaker by birth, therefore educated to
respect every man’s religion, and to believe that
every man respects mine, nevertheless I felt misgivings
incumbent upon the meeting of extremes. I was
ushered into a large drawing-room and was examining
the pictures, which generally tell the character of the
owner, when Mr. Chatard entered. As he asked me
to be seated, I thought, as some one has expressed it
before me, “the whole world over, there are but two
kinds of people,—‘man and woman.’”</p>

<p>The youth of this college may thank their stars that
America has given them one of her most learned and
worthy sons, though the sect to which his mother
once belonged must deplore his loss.</p>

<p>In conversation with this Reverend gentleman, I
obtained the requirements necessary to an introduction
to the Pope, and was a little surprised that he
should question my willingness to conform to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
same. It was however, explained. He had been
much embarrassed by the demeanor of some of the
American women. Seeking the privilege of meeting
the Pope in his own palace, where common courtesy
and etiquette naturally demand a deference to the
Lord of the Manor, yet these ladies, having previously
guaranteed a compliance with the laws of ceremony,
after gaining admission refused to obey them.</p>

<p>Seeing the Pope was not, to me, a religious service
and is not generally so considered.</p>

<p>My only fear was that my plain manners in their
brusqueness, would have the appearance of “omission.”</p>

<p>But the requirements are simple. Bending the
knee, as a physical performance, was a source of anxiety.
I at once called to mind the great difficulty
which, as a young girl, I had in the play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If I <i>had</i> as many wives</div>
<div class="verse">As the stars in the skies,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the person who had to kneel in the
game had a large cushion to throw before her to receive
the fall, I always shook the house from the foundations
when I went down. I can hear the pendants
now, of a chandelier in a certain frame house in my
native town ring out my weight, as I flung the cushion
in front of a boy that knew “he was not the one,”
and took to my knees. True, the Vatican is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
shaky in its underpinnings, and faithful practice
upon the floor of my apartment in Bocca di Leone, I
thought, would be productive of some good. Quickly
running through this train of reflection, and finally
trusting that the gathering would not be disturbed by
any marked awkwardness, I returned home to await
the tidings.</p>

<p><i>Monday Evening.</i> Have seen Pio Nono—have
committed no enormity.</p>

<p>According to directions, in black dress, black veil,
<i>à la</i> Spanish lady, ungloved hands (what an appearance
at a Presidential reception!) we were attired.
Took a carriage for the Vatican. Before we left home
the padrona viewed us, pronounced us all right, and
earnestly sought the privilege of selecting a coach for
us. She had an eye to style. Is it possible that she
did not give us credit for the same “strength,” and
we traveling Americans? It is to be confessed that
the horses were less like donkeys than otherwise
might have been. Trying the knee the last thing
before leaving the house, there was certainly reason
for encouragement, though still a lingering humility.</p>

<p>Our ride was subdued, but we reached St. Peter’s,
passed through the elegant halls of the Pope’s Palace,
surpassed only by those of the Pitti at Florence
in their gold and fresco, and were ushered into the reception
room of Pio Nono.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>This apartment, long and narrow, seemed more
like a corridor than a hall. Its beauties are described
in various guide books, so that “they who read can
see.”</p>

<p>We were the only Protestants. The other ladies
were laden with magnificent rosaries, pictures, toys,
ribbons, etc., for the Holy Father’s blessing. Even I
purchased one of the first, viz., a rosary, to undergo
the same ceremony, as a gift to a much-loved servant
girl at home.</p>

<p>We sat here many minutes in quiet (inwardly longing
to try the fall.) At length the Pope was led in.
We forgot our trials. A countenance so benign,
beaming with goodness, spread a cheer throughout
the assembly. We took the floor naturally and involuntarily.
Except in dress, he might have been any
old patriarch. The white robe, long and plain, gave
him rather the appearance of a matriarch.</p>

<p>It chanced that his Holiness passed first up the
right side of the hall. We sat <i>vis à vis</i>, so that we
had the benefit of all that he said before we came in
turn. While addressing the right, who continue on
their knees, the left rise. As he turns to the latter
they again kneel, whereas those opposite change from
this posture to the standing.</p>

<p>The Pope talked now in French, now in Italian,
mostly in the former. As he approached our party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
we were introduced merely as Americans, but our
religion was stamped upon our brows. Turning
kindly to my young daughter, who wore, as an ornament,
a chain and cross, he said, as if quite sure
of the fact, “<i>You</i> can wear your cross outside, as an
adornment; I am obliged to wear mine inside as a
cross;” whereupon, with a smile, he drew this emblem
from his wide ribbon sash, showing her a most elegant
massive cross of gold and diamonds, probably the
most valuable one in the world. As he replaced this
mark of his devotion, his countenance expressing a
recognition of our Protestantism, perhaps a pity for
our future, placing his hand upon our heads, he passed
on. The blessing of a good old man, whatever his
faith, can injure no one, and may not be without its
efficacy, even though it rest upon a disciple of George
Fox.</p>

<p>I shall never cease to be glad that I have seen Pio
Nono.</p>

<h2><a name="A_LESSON_IN_ITALIAN" id="A_LESSON_IN_ITALIAN">A LESSON IN ITALIAN.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“DO you speak English?”</p>

<p>“<i>Non, Signora!</i>”</p>

<p>“Do you speak any other language than Italian?”</p>

<p>“<i>Non, Signora!</i>”</p>

<p>“Then you are the person I desire as guide!”</p>

<p>The above dialogue took place near the Amphitheatre
of Verona. The Italian, standing awaiting
employment, was an old man, bright and active.
The American, who addressed him was an elderly
woman, who had studied the languages of Europe
nearly half a century. She had just arrived in
Verona. Leaving the younger members of her party
she had strolled off alone, the better, as she said, to
air her lore. One must be alone to succeed with a
foreign tongue; an audience of one’s own countrymen
is particularly distracting if not embarrassing.</p>

<p>Following her leader into the Amphitheatre she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sat where, ages ago, the Royalty had done, and commenced
audible reflections to this effect:</p>

<p>“Did scenes such as took place here have a charm
for court ladies, ladies educated as were the Zenobias
and the Julias of those days?”</p>

<p>She had no idea that her language could be understood,
but the guide vociferated as if angry:</p>

<p>“People of those days were great, strong, just!”</p>

<p>She felt that she was answered, but nevertheless
was practicing her Italian.</p>

<p>The Amphitheatre of Verona, being in a state of
preservation, is a good introduction to the Coliseum
at Rome. The old man, my guide, was present at
the Congress of 1822, when twenty-two thousand persons
were seated within its walls. The Chariot Entrance
is pointed out, also that through which the culprits
came; and the gate which held back the hungry
animal longing for his prize. These oft told tales
were recited by the guide, as are the speeches of
Daniel Webster by the American school-boy, learned
and rehearsed many times, till the traveler, having exhausted
her own vocabulary as applied to this show,
seemed ready to depart.</p>

<p>“Cathedrals,” proposed the conductor as a matter
of course. Cathedrals consequently obtained.</p>

<p>In one of these of the time of Charlemagne, the guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
seized with a religious zeal, begged his companion to be
seated while he joined in the services. She could not
conscientiously interfere with his soul’s instincts,
therefore consented to rest awhile.</p>

<p>The performances seemed exceedingly tedious, as
the monotone of the priest was relieved only by the
click of the collections. But the old man was very
devout, never allowing the box to pass without his
contribution. Magnanimous spirit! How many of
our home churches would give twice and thrice without
wincing?</p>

<p>Growing rather anxious to leave these premises, the
Protestant tried to hurry the brother-at-prayer by a
motion towards the door.</p>

<p>“Will Madame condescend a ten minutes longer?
A collection for a deceased infant is next.”</p>

<p>Madame did condescend. The coin was deposited.
After this emotional act the twain left the church, the
guide very gay and lively, the lady rather moved to
compassion. Suppose her companion <i>were</i> steeped
in ignorance, how beautiful his faith!</p>

<p>“Was the little child a relative, or were its parents
his friends?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! he had never heard of it in life, but only
a hard heart would keep one so young and alone in
the shades.” Here he wiped a tear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The guide turned, quickly melting into the
smile again, remarking: “The Tombs of the Scaligers.”</p>

<p>These monuments are indeed worth seeing, especially
that of the last of this great family. This Scaliger,
to outdo his ancestry had spent many years laboring
with his own hands upon the marble which
was to mark his resting-place. The devices were his
own; no other person was employed in the hewing,
the cutting, even in the erection of this showy memorial.
Its maker died satisfied with the result of his
lifetime, a work for ages to succeed.</p>

<p>The oldest of this name rests under a comparatively
simple canopy. During the First Napoleon’s
time this tomb was opened that a cast might be made
of the head, there being no authentic representation
extant; and by order of the Emperor, the bust was
placed in the Louvre at Paris, and sketches of this
wonderfully fine head sold for great sums.</p>

<p>“The house of the Capulets,” said the old man.</p>

<p>Standing beneath the balcony on the very spot
where stood poor Romeo (or Charlotte Cushman as
well), quite absorbed in the few lines of Shakspeare
that floated in her mind, the lady was aroused from
her revery by the guide, who, pointing at the almost
obliterated coat-of-arms, said ambitiously:</p>

<p>“<i>Chapeau, capello, Inglese!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time he crushed his head-gear, till
his face was quite covered.</p>

<p>“Hat!” shrieked she, judging that one who can
not speak English must be deaf to this tongue though
in proper condition to hear his native. If there is
any letter that an Italian cannot pronounce, it is the
“h.” His attempts were many and fruitless. At
length, violently coughing out the aspirate, he added
with great gusto the “at” and was satisfied though
exhausted. His next effort was “how;” his next
“head,” and finally “woman.” If there is any letter
after “h” that the Italian can <i>not</i> get, it is our “w”
and lo! his choice of first steps in English, “hat,
head, how and woman.”</p>

<p>Passing through the market-places which are gorgeous
in the distance, but whose goods when inspected
are very common, they were met by many
beggars. To those dressed in a peculiar garb the
guide invariably gave, at no time to those in any other
suit. He always reached the mite with a smile, good
soul that he was!</p>

<p>Overlooking the lovely Adige they stood upon the
great bridge, when it suddenly occurred to madame
that the humble individual beside her might be giving
her more time than customary, even as he had
freely given to God’s “poor in other respects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Feeling satisfied with her day’s work and knowing
her way to the hotel, she commenced the process of
bidding him adieu—in more common parlance, “getting
clear of him.”</p>

<p>“I am indeed obliged to you,” began she. “I have
learned so much Ital—”</p>

<p>Here she was interrupted by the sage Mentor.</p>

<p>“If madame is so well pleased with my services, as
she has taught me much English (the hypocrite,) I
shall take but <i>twelve lire</i>.”</p>

<p>“<i>Twelve lire!</i>” she quietly repeated after him,
while her astonishment was mingling with rage within,
so as to render her voice almost inaudible.</p>

<p>“Five <i>lire should</i> be your demand,” she humbly
ventured at last.</p>

<p>“Madame is quite right, but she forgets her three
worships in the Cathedral and the many who partook
of her bounty in the market!”</p>

<p>“Three worships,” thought she with a perplexed
air, “and bounties in the market!”</p>

<p>As if reading her mind, he explained by means of
gestures that the contributions made in the church
were charged to her, (probably with added interest
by the time the account reached her;) also the coins
given to the various mendicants in their walks.</p>

<p>Alas! A Quaker by parentage, educated to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
no clergy in her own Protestant land, had here been
playing into the hands of the foreign devotee! She
nevertheless submitted with a grace, trusting that the
next edition of Ollendorff will change its sentence of:</p>

<p>“Has he the hammer of the good blacksmith or
the waistcoat of the handsome joiner,” etc., into</p>

<p>“Has she the shrewdness of the saintly guide or
the mask of the beggar in the market-place?” She
has neither the shrewdness of the saintly guide,
neither the mask of the beggar; she has a meagre
purse and a “<i>thorough lesson in Italian</i>.”</p>

<h2><a name="FEEDING_GHOSTS_IN_CHINA" id="FEEDING_GHOSTS_IN_CHINA">FEEDING GHOSTS IN CHINA.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE carpenter who has been making our new
book-case says he wants to go to his home
for a few days—some work is awaiting him there;
the Chinese writer says <i>he</i> wishes to go—there is a
message to be sent in the direction of his village, he
can carry it, and, being at leisure, can spend a few
days with his family; our house boy says <i>he</i>, also,
must go—his “muddar” has been sick, is now
“more better,” and he must go and see her.</p>

<p>And so the carpenter and the writer have gone,
and the boy is going; but it seems so strange, their
all asking to go at the same time, that I suspect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
at least part of them had some untold reason for it,
and, when I remind myself that it is now the last of
August, that it is the time of the full moon, and that
last night our Chinese neighbors were going about
out of doors carrying bowls of boiled rice, and that
in front of the houses in the street near by were little
fires with those thin, filmy ash-flakes that remain
from burned paper scattered about them, I feel sure
that I have guessed the reason, and that it is a wish
to celebrate at their own homes the Festival of Burning
Clothes, and the Friendless Ghost’s Feast.</p>

<p>The Chinese think that persons after they are dead
need the same things as when they are alive, and
that if they are not supplied with them they can revenge
themselves upon people in this world, bringing
them ill-health or bad luck in business. This being
the case, of course people try to keep the ghosts of
their relations in as comfortable and quiet a state as
they can.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 91px;">
<img src="images/i-065.jpg" width="91" height="186" alt="pillar" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Tablet.</span></div>
</div>
<p>If a father should die, his friends, while he remained
unburied, would every day put a dish of rice
and, perhaps, a basin of water, by his coffin, so that
his ghost might eat and wash. Afterwards, they
would at times carry food and drink to his grave, or
place it before the wooden tablet, which, to honor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
him, would be set up in his house.
To supply him with clothes and
money, or anything else he might
need, like a house, a boat or a chair,
paper imitations of these things would
be made and burned, after which it
would be thought the ghost could
make use of them. Fifteen days at
this season of the year are considered
the most lucky time for making these
offerings. Large quantities of clothes
and other paper articles are then sold, and there
is a great burning of them all over the country.</p>


<p>Besides these well-to-do family ghosts, there is another
class of whom people are dreadfully afraid.
These are the spirits of very wicked men, and of
childless persons who have left nobody behind them
in this world to care for them. They are supposed
to be wandering about in a most forlorn condition
and to be able to do a great deal of mischief. To put
them in good humor, and to induce them to keep out
of the way of the living, a Feast is made for them
every summer.</p>

<p>For several years past, this feast has been given in
an open plot of ground just outside our yard and
under our sitting-room windows, so that I have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
seen it, though I am obliged to say I have never spied
any ghosts coming to eat of it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/i-066.jpg" width="297" height="249" alt="hut with a platform on raised spikes" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Ghosts’ Table.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Every year the ceremonies are the same. Early in
the day four tall poles are planted in the ground
about a dozen feet apart, and so placed as to mark a
square; about twenty feet from the ground a wooden
floor is built between the poles. A few men who
stand upon this platform direct everything. Usually,
one or two of them seem to be priests; once, I recognized
the leader as an expert juggler whose tricks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
I had witnessed only a short time before. A part of
the Feast has been made ready beforehand and is at
once arranged on the platform. At two corners are
placed ornamented cones, six or eight feet high,
which, I suppose, it is expected will appear to the
ghosts to be solid cakes, but which are, in reality, only
bamboo frames, thinly plastered over with a mixture
of flour and sugar; besides these are green oranges,
other fresh fruits, and articles of different kinds.
Soon, offerings of food begin to come in from the
neighborhood, and are drawn up by ropes to the platform;
these are, mostly, baskets of boiled rice, and
have a bit of wood holding a red paper stuck in the
middle of the rice. I suppose the giver’s name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
upon the paper, and after the Feast the baskets seem
to be restored to the persons who brought them; the
rice can then be taken away, and eaten at home.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 158px;">
<img src="images/i-067.jpg" width="158" height="190" alt="round ball of rice in basket with note stuck in top on a stick" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Ghost’s Meal.</span></div>
</div>

<p>At length, the platform is well laden with food,
which remains exposed in the sun and wind for several
hours, during which time a great noise is kept up
with gongs and other musical instruments, partly, I
suppose, like a dinner bell to call the ghosts, and
partly to amuse the men and boys who gather in an
interested crowd around the platform.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the head men begin to distribute
the Feast. The baskets of food are carefully
lowered; the cakes are broken up, and the pieces,
with the oranges and other fruits, are flung hither
and thither among the crowd, who scramble merrily
after them, sometimes half a dozen rushing after the
same fragment, and now and then a man trying to
clamber up the poles to secure a portion before it
falls. When the stage is cleared the crowd disperses,
and the Ghosts’ Feast is ended.</p>

<p>In this region the people are very poor, but in a
large and rich community this festivity would be kept
with splendor even, and with much cost.</p>

<p>Last year, a part of the wooden frame-work fell,
and one man was injured. I think this may make
the old ground seem unlucky to the Chinese, and lead
them to seek a new place for this year’s Feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us hope that they will do so, for to have a set
of the most wicked and unhappy ghosts asked to dinner
under one’s windows, is not, after all, so amusing
as it is noisy and sadly foolish.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHILDREN_OF_THE" id="THE_CHILDREN_OF_THE">THE CHILDREN OF THE
KOPPENBERG.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM Hanover to Hameln is a good twenty-five
mile walk, with a mountain at the end:
to go over which, however, shortens the journey
by several miles.</p>

<p>In the case of Tom Osgood and Fred Taylor,
who reached the foot of the mountain towards the
close of what had been to them a long and weary
day, the one—that is, Tom—concluded to go
around the mountain, while Fred chose the shorter
if rougher path over the top. Why the boys should
have taken this long and tiresome tramp when a
railroad runs the whole way in sight of the road
which they travelled, or why they should not have
walked to Hildesheim, or Minden, or Nienburg, or
any other of the equally unattractive places within
the same distance from Hanover, I am sure I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
not know. If they had, though—and for that matter
if one of them had not chosen to climb the Koppenberg
rather than go around it—this story would
most likely have never been written.</p>

<p>For my own part I am very glad they did it; and
Fred Taylor as long as he lives will never cease to
be glad that he was the one to take the mountain
path, though with the pleasure—as indeed is the
case with nearly all our best pleasures—there
will always come a little sudden thrill of pain.</p>

<p>Why the mountain was called the Koppenberg does
not concern this story at all. It is quite enough to
know that it was a pretty tough mountain to climb
and that before Fred was a quarter of the way up he
began to be sorry he had not taken the longer route
with Tom. It was too late now however to turn back;
and besides unless he made good time Tom would
beat him in the race, which considering the greater
distance Tom had to travel would be humiliating in
the extreme. So putting a little extra steam in his
legs, and whistling a tune his quick ear had picked
up on the way, he trudged on, up the steep road,
through the terraced vineyards, past an old ruin here
and a herdsman’s hut there, until finally the road
lost itself in a path and went winding up into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
woods which covered the mountain for more than
half the distance from its top.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">
<img src="images/i-072.jpg" width="579" height="388" alt="piper playing in crowd of people; wind is blowing is cloak" />
<div class="caption">THE PIPER SOUNDED ONE SHARP NOTE.</div>
</div>

<p>It was late in the afternoon; but in Hanover on
the 26th of June the sun does not set until nearly
half-past eight, so that Fred had no fear of being
overtaken by the dark.</p>

<p>For some time Fred had not heard a sound but his
own whistle. Indeed now that he was fairly in the
solitude of the woods he did not expect to hear or
meet any one, and he was accordingly startled when
suddenly out of the deeper woods came a sound that
seemed to be another whistle answering his own.</p>

<p>Fred stopped and listened.</p>

<p>Was it a whistle? or were they the notes of a flute?</p>

<p>At any rate it could be nothing dangerous.
Highwaymen and banditti do not usually whistle or
play musical instruments, and Fred felt that it would
be perfectly safe to push on. As he drew nearer, the
tones became louder and with them were mixed what
were unmistakably the voices of children. Fred,
with increasing curiosity, hastened his steps; and in
another moment a sight that was as odd as it was
pretty met his eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, they were children—as many as a hundred
of them, Fred thought—funny little old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
German children; the girls with long flaxen braids
and dresses that might have been their grandmothers’,
and the boys with garments so extraordinary that
Fred, who thought he could never be astonished by
what a German boy might have on, was fairly lost in
surprise.</p>

<p>But more odd than all the rest was the musician
himself—a tall, thin, smooth-faced man, with blue
eyes and scanty hair and an astonishing cloak, half of
yellow and half of red, that reached from his shoulders
to his heels. He was playing, on what seemed to be
a flageolet, a brisk enlivening tune, and was lightly
beating time with his feet.</p>

<p>Fred looked on in amazement. “It must be a
Sunday-school picnic,” he said to himself at last,
“only I never heard of such a thing in Germany,
and what a queer-looking man for a superintendent.”</p>

<p>If it were a Sunday-school picnic it was a very
remarkable one. There were no grown-up people at
all but the one man, and the children seemed to be
having no end of a good time. There were two little
girls, it is true, standing quietly and soberly not far
from Fred, but all of the others were either dancing
or playing some lively game.</p>

<p>Fred could not help wondering why the two were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
left out; and going up to them he asked in his politest
manner and best German: “Why aren’t you dancing
and why do you look so sad when everybody else is
so happy?”</p>

<p>The little things looked up curiously. They were
pretty, Fred thought, but not so pretty as another
and older girl who came out of the crowd just then
and overheard Fred’s question.</p>

<p>“They’ve been sad all day,” she answered in a
pretty, motherly way; “their little brothers were left
behind and they can’t enjoy it because their brothers
aren’t enjoying it too.”</p>

<p>“Mine was lame,” said one of the little girls
sadly.</p>

<p>“And mine was dumb,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Oh come!” said Fred, “you’d better go in and
have a dance. It will be getting dark before long
and you’ll have to go home and then you can tell
your little brothers all about it.”</p>

<p>The little children seemed puzzled and a grave
look came on the elder girl’s face.</p>

<p>“It is never dark,” she said. “It is always light
here.”</p>

<p>It seemed indeed to be lighter than before.
Where it had come from, Fred could not tell, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
all the forest was lit up with a strange warm glow.
There were beautiful flowers too growing at his feet
and birds singing in the air that Fred had not noticed
before.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and dance?” the girl went on.</p>

<p>Fred was very fond of dancing, and it was hard to
refrain, especially since the music was now fairly exhilarating;
but he was very tired and had still before
him a tedious climb. Under the circumstances he
would rather rest himself by talking to this pretty
sweet-voiced German girl—if she would only stay.</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth,” he said apologetically,
“I’ve walked from Hanover to-day and I’m rather
tired. But I’d like awfully to talk to you. Can’t
you stay away from them for a few minutes? You
aren’t a teacher, are you?”</p>

<p>“A teacher?” inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Isn’t it a Sunday-school?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand.”</p>

<p>Fred thought his German must be at fault.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” he said, “‘<i>Sontags-schule</i>,’
that’s what they call it in New York. I’ve seen it on
the German churches.”</p>

<p>“New York? what is that?”</p>

<p>Fred gazed in greater astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you don’t mean to say you don’t know where
New York is?”</p>

<p>The girl shook her head in a dreamy, abstracted
way.</p>

<p>“I have heard of Hameln,” she said, “and Hanover,
and Jerusalem where the Holy Sepulchre is. It
was there the Count Rudolph went to war against the
Turks. But he never came back. Do you know,”
eagerly, “whether the Christians have taken Jerusalem?”</p>

<p>“My gracious!” exclaimed Fred below his breath,
“it must be a lunatic asylum!” Then aloud: “Why
there hasn’t been a war in Jerusalem for five hundred
years—not since the crusades.”</p>

<p>She passed her hand across her forehead in a bewildered
way.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, “it seems as though I
had forgotten. Perhaps it’s because I don’t talk.
I’m the eldest, and all the others dance and play
games, and the <i>Piper</i>, he plays all the time and so I
don’t have anybody to talk to at all.”</p>

<p>Fred was now quite confirmed in his new idea; and
yet the girl was so pretty and gentle that he could not
bear to think of her being out of her mind.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go back,” he asked kindly, “if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
you’re unhappy? Was it Hameln you came from?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“It was so long ago,” she said, “I can’t recollect.”</p>

<p>“Well, it couldn’t have been much over fourteen
years. I’m only fifteen myself. Perhaps I’d ought
to have introduced myself. I’m Fred Taylor, of New
York and I’m studying German at Hanover. It’s
purer there, you know, than it is most anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>Fred was uncertain how much she understood. Her
own language, he had noticed, was very simple, and
when he used an unaccustomed word her forehead
would contract as though she could not follow him.
Her next words, though, showed that she had understood
his introduction.</p>

<p>“I am Gretchen Haffelfinger,” she said simply;
“and you must not think I am not happy, because I
am. The <i>Piper</i> is very kind to us.”</p>

<p>“And do you live up here all the time?”</p>

<p>Her forehead contracted again.</p>

<p>“What is time?” she asked.</p>

<p>This was a problem that Fred wasn’t prepared to
solve and he discreetly changed the form of his
question.</p>

<p>“Do you live near here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl’s look turned toward a long glade in the
forest, through which Fred fancied he could see a
lofty castle with battlemented walls and windows that
gleamed in the strange, rich glow.</p>

<p>“Is that the asylum?” he cried.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand,” wistfully.</p>

<p>What was there she did understand? Fred’s
heart warmed compassionately toward the simple-minded
child, while a sudden thought came into his
head. Once back in her own place—if Hameln were
her own place—might not the familiar scenes bring
back her scattered wits? Of the difficulties in the
way he did not think.</p>

<p>“Say, Gretchen!” he whispered, eagerly, “wouldn’t
you like to go back with me to Hameln?”</p>

<p>A sudden light gleamed in the soft eyes and her
breath came and went quickly as she moved a step
nearer and looked beseechingly into his face. Fred
will always insist that if they had started at that moment
she would have gotten off. He reached forward,
and for one instant her warm little hand lay in
his. But before he could fairly grasp it, the <i>Piper</i>
had sounded one clear, sharp note; the fingers that
he so nearly held drew themselves away; the blue
eyes which had been fixed on his, turned with a troubled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
look to the <i>Piper;</i> the slight form moved back,
at first a single step, then slowly retreated from Fred’s
side, while the children, attracted by the same call,
came running from all directions and formed in a
double column behind their curiously dressed leader.
In another moment the whole procession was in motion.
Fred counted them mechanically as they filed
by. Without Gretchen, who still delayed, or the
<i>Piper</i>, there were just one hundred and twenty-nine.</p>

<p>What a weird intoxicating march it was! The
children, for their part, laughed and sang; the <i>Piper</i>
played as though he, too, were insane; and even Fred
could scarcely resist the impulse to join in. If he did
not get away he felt that he should be carried off by
the music in spite of himself. But he would make at
least one more effort to save his little friend.</p>

<p>“Gretchen!” he cried, holding out his hands.</p>

<p>She smiled, half sadly, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“Gretchen!” he cried once more, “come!”</p>

<p>There was no answer. The music had suddenly
stopped, the <i>Piper</i> with the children had vanished;
and, while Fred looked, the little maiden with the soft
eyes and tender wistful smile faded out of his sight.
The glow had gone, too, with the birds and the flowers;
there was no longer any battlemented castle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the distance: it was the shade of the forest, and Fred
was all alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom Osgood meanwhile had trudged his scarcely
less weary way along the road around the foot of the
mountain, and about seven o’clock had reached the
city gate. Not that there was any gate—that had
been gone for generations—but there was an old
stone archway overgrown with ivy, in and out of
which the birds fluttered and under which Tom had
to walk to enter the city. Just before reaching it, he
stopped for a moment and looked down into the river
that flowed swiftly below the city walls. The sight
struck a chord of recollection.</p>

<p>“What was it I used to read about this place?” he
asked himself. “Seems to me it was in a piece I
spoke once at school.”</p>

<p>He waited a minute, but memory made no response.
Then picking up his satchel he pushed on
into the town.</p>

<p>To his surprise, when he had reached the hotel
where they had agreed to meet, Fred was not there
nor had anything been heard of him. The <i>Portier</i>
assured Tom that the road was perfectly plain and
nothing could have happened; but this did not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
relieve him and it was with a good deal of
anxiety, having ordered supper, that he sat down to
wait. His suspense, however, did not last long. In
fifteen minutes the door opened and Fred came in.</p>

<p>That something had happened, Tom guessed at
once. There was a strange look of excitement on
Fred’s face, and his step was more active, Tom
thought, than a boy’s ought to be who had just
walked over the Koppenberg.</p>

<p>“Feel my pulse, won’t you, Tom?” he cried nervously,
throwing down his satchel, “and see if I’ve
got a fever. Did I seem out of my head when I left
you? Did I talk wild, Tom? Did you ever hear of
insanity in my family? Really and truly, Tom, I
don’t know whether I’m crazy or not.”</p>

<p>Tom was gazing at his friend in speechless astonishment.</p>

<p>“What in the world’s got into you?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“It didn’t get into me. I got into it; and it was a
lunatic asylum as near as I could make out. Only
the keeper looked like a clown in a circus and the
rest were all children. I tried to get one of them
away, Tom”—Fred’s voice broke a little—“but
just then the whole thing vanished, just like people
do in a dream, you know. I don’t know where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
went. I could see the spot where she stood, but she
wasn’t there—”</p>

<p>“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?” interrupted
Tom.</p>

<p>“Dreaming!” indignantly. “Do I generally dream
in daylight? Would I stop to dream when I was in
such a hurry to get here ahead of you? and besides,
Tom, I can whistle the march the man played. Just
listen.”</p>

<p>Fred was a good whistler and never had to hear a
tune more than once to remember it perfectly. Now
his excitement lent strength and clearness to his notes
so that any one might have taken them for those of
the <i>Piper</i> himself. So loud and clear were they indeed
that the <i>Portier</i> was drawn by them from his desk,
the <i>Ober-kellner</i> from the dining-room, the Director
from the office, and most of the guests from the reading
and smoking rooms. In fact, before Fred was through
he had quite an audience, most of whom, he noticed,
had a puzzled, inquiring look on their faces as
though something about the whistle or the tune were
out of the way. What the look meant he did not
have to wait long to find out.</p>

<p>“You whistle very well, sir,” the Director remarked,
almost before Fred was fairly through; “but perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
you are not aware that that tune is forbidden in
Hameln.”</p>

<p>Fred was surprised, and a little frightened.</p>

<p>“Why,” he stammered, “I only learned it to-day.”</p>

<p>“Not from any one in Hameln?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t suppose it was. He was on the other
side of the mountain.”</p>

<p>The Director shook his head sagaciously.</p>

<p>“It is not allowed in Hameln,” he repeated; “I
wouldn’t whistle it again if I were you.”</p>

<p>“But why not?” demanded Fred. “Why can’t a
man whistle what he likes?”</p>

<p>“For the same reason,” gravely, “that it is forbidden
to play music of any kind in the <i>Bungenstrasse</i>.”</p>

<p>Fred stared.</p>

<p>“What is the <i>Bungenstrasse?</i>” he asked; “and
why may not one play in it?”</p>

<p>“Do not the young <i>herren</i> know the story?”</p>

<p>The young <i>herren</i> did not know the story, or if
they did had forgotten it.</p>

<p>“Is there a story?” cried Tom. “Tell it to us,
won’t you, Herr Director?”</p>

<p>The Director bowed gravely.</p>

<p>“Probably the young <i>herren</i> will recall it, for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of their English poets has written about it. It happened
nearly six hundred years ago that the town of
Hameln was overrun with rats—”</p>

<p>That was enough. Tom had found his clue.</p>

<p>“Of course I’ve read it!” he cried. “That was
what I’ve been trying to remember all day:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Hamelin town’s in Brunswick,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">By famous Hanover city;</span></div>
<div class="verse">The River Weser, deep and wide,</div>
<div class="verse">Washes its wall on the southern side’—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Don’t you recollect, Fred? They couldn’t get rid of
them, and one day an old fellow came into town and
offered to pipe them out for a thousand dollars or
whatever it was, and they took him up. But when he
had done it, and the rats were all drowned in the
river, they wouldn’t stick to the bargain, and so he
struck up his pipe again, and this time all the children
followed him—why, what’s the matter, Fred?”</p>

<p>“The young gentleman is ill,” exclaimed the <i>Portier</i>,
and would have rushed off for a doctor, had not
Fred interfered.</p>

<p>“No! no!” impatiently, “I’m not sick, Tom; but
don’t you see? Is it so?” turning to the Director,
“Is that the story?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The Director nodded. He was flattered by their
interest, and besides nothing that an American did
ever surprised him.</p>

<p>“Evidently the young gentleman has read it,” he
said. “All the children in town followed him as far as
the mountain side, and then, when their fathers and
mothers thought they could go no further, the mountain
opened and they were all swallowed up—all, that is,
but one little boy who was dumb, and another who
was lame. This was the street they went down. On
the <i>Rattenfangerhauser</i> opposite is a tablet commemorating
the event; and ever since that time there has
been no music played in the <i>Bungenstrasse</i>. Even
if a bridal procession goes through the street the
music must not play. And the tune which you were
whistling was the tune the Piper played. It was scored
at the time by the <i>Kapellmeister</i>, and every one in
Hameln knows it, just as one knows the <i>Wacht am
Rhein;</i> but no one may play it, or whistle it, or sing
it on the streets. Of course, if the young gentleman
had known it was forbidden he would not have whistled
it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Fred, abstractedly. “Where
is the house with the inscription on it? Can we see
it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the Director. “It is not yet too
dark. The house is yonder on the corner of the
<i>Osterstrasse</i>.”</p>

<p>By this time Tom was burning with curiosity, and
longing for a chance to speak with Fred alone.</p>

<p>“Come along,” he cried, “let’s go over to the old
place and look at it.”</p>

<p>Fred was not unwilling, and tired and hungry
though they were, both boys rushed out of the hall
across the Platz. The hotel people interchanged smiles
and shrugs, the <i>Ober-kellner</i> went back to the dining-room,
the <i>Portier</i> to his desk, the Director to his
office and the guests to their rooms. “Americans!”
one said to the other, quite as though that dismissed
the subject.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which it took to cross the
square, Fred gave his friend all the particulars of the
story which in his excitement he had not before
supplied, and for lack of which Tom had not been
able until now to obtain a clear idea of what had
happened. “Then your idea is,” he said soberly,
when Fred had finished, “that those were the children
who were lost?”</p>

<p>Fred nodded gravely. “I suppose they must have
been,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“And that the man was the Pied Piper of
Hameln?”</p>

<p>Fred nodded as before. By this time they were
in front of the house and had discovered the inscription,
which was written in queer old characters, once
gilded, but now
so weather
beaten as to be
scarcely legible.</p>

<p>“What in the
world does it
say?” asked Tom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/i-089.jpg" width="326" height="291" alt="house with plaque" />
<div class="caption">THE RAT-CATCHER’S HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>Fred scanned it as closely as he could in the fading
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell,” he said. “Part of it is Latin
and part German; but it’s badly spelled, and there is
some of it that must be Dutch. As near as I can
make out it reads like this:</p>

<p>“<i>Anno 1284 am dage Johannis et Pauli war der 26
Junii dorch einen Piper mit allerei farve bekledet
gewesen 130 Kinder verledet binnen Hameln gebon to
Calvarie, bi den Koppen verloren!</i>”</p>

<p>“What gibberish!” Tom exclaimed. “Do you
suppose you can translate it?”</p>

<p>Fred looked uncertain; but began word by word,
as one construes a Latin lesson in school.</p>

<p>“<i>Anno</i> 1284, in the year 1284, <i>am dage Johannis et
Pauli</i>, on the day of St. John and St. Paul, <i>war der
26 Junii</i>, which was the 26th of June—this very
day, Tom—a piper with <i>allerlei farve bekledet</i>—that
must be parti-colored clothes—led 130 children
born in Hameln by the Koppenberg to Calvary.
That means to their death I suppose.”</p>

<p>Tom nodded, and for a minute the boys looked
at one another without speaking.</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do about it?” asked
Tom at length.</p>

<p>With another look at the tablet Fred turned towards
the hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s nothing to be done about it,” he said.
“I don’t think I had better tell anybody here.”</p>

<p>Tom deliberated a minute.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think you had,” he said. “It happened
five hundred and ninety-five years ago: there aren’t
any of their relatives alive, and nobody would believe
you anyhow. Besides, they seemed to be having a
good time, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>Fred’s thoughtful gaze was turned down the street
toward the mountain, where so many years ago the
little feet had pattered to their grave.</p>

<p>But <i>was</i> it to their grave?</p>

<p>He wondered if instead of dying they had not lived
all that time, and whether any one else had ever seen
them besides himself. He was so absorbed indeed
that he did not hear Tom’s question until it was
repeated.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you speak?” he asked. “Yes, I suppose
they were. She said so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad of that. I always felt sorry for
the poor little beggars and wondered if they got out
of the other side of the hill. It’s a great relief, Fred,
to think of their having a good time. The Piper
couldn’t have been a bad sort of fellow. As it turned
out, Fred, you might say as the little lame boy—it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
must have been his sister, by the way, you spoke
to—did in the poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘The music stopped and I stood still,</div>
<div class="verse">And found myself outside the hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Left alone against my will,</div>
<div class="verse">To go now limping as before,</div>
<div class="verse">And never hear of that country more.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Fred drew a long breath of relief as he brought
his thoughts back from the mountain.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I’m glad I know who they were.
I couldn’t bear to think of their being lunatics.
And if Gretchen and the two little girls had been as
happy as all the rest, I should have thought—”</p>

<p>“What would you have thought?”</p>

<p>Fred hesitated an instant.</p>

<p>“That I was getting a little glimpse into heaven.
But then, it couldn’t be that, you know.”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head wisely.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he said; “of course it couldn’t be
that.”</p>

<h2><a name="A_DAY_AT_THE_BUTTS" id="A_DAY_AT_THE_BUTTS">A DAY AT THE BUTTS.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was the fourth day of August, more than a hundred
years ago, and the whole road between
London and the little village of Harrow was thronged
with people. It was hot and dusty enough that summer
morning, but nobody seemed to mind in the
eager scramble for the best seats; and it was not
long before the little green knoll, just at the west of
the London road, seemed fairly alive with spectators.</p>

<p>It was a lovely spot—this well-known Butts of
Harrow—with its crown of tall forest trees waving
like so many banners, and its tiers of grassy seats
terracing the slope. From time immemorial it had
been the scene of annual contests in archery, and
there was not a boy in Harrow School who did not
look forward all the year to this fourth day of August.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>When John Lyon founded the school it was made
a condition of entrance, that every pupil should be
furnished with the proper implements of archery;
and among the school ordinances drawn up in the
year 1592 there was one to the effect that every
child should, at all times, be allowed bow-shafts,
bow-strings, and a bracer.</p>

<p>No wonder the men of those days were tall, and
straight, and strong!</p>

<p>But hark! The church clock down in the village
is striking the appointed hour. A little figure, clad
in red satin from head to foot, darts out from the
thicket of trees below, and now a procession of twelve
boys, some in white, some in red, and some in green
satin, take their places in the open ring that has been
left for the competitors. All the little archers have
sashes and caps of bright-colored silk, and, looking
down from the green knoll, the whole scene is a
kaleidoscope of color.</p>

<p>A silver arrow—the victor’s prize—glitters temptingly
in the sunlight; and a tall lad, who stands
among the waiting twelve, bends eagerly forward to
examine it.</p>

<p>“Just look at Percival!” whispers one little archer
to his neighbor. “He’s bound to get that arrow,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pooh! who cares for the arrow?” responds the
other, disdainfully. “It’s nothing but a plaything,
anyway! What I think about is winning the game,
not the arrow!”</p>

<p>“Yes; but you see it’s different with Percival!”
said the first speaker. “His three older brothers, three
years in succession, won the arrows while they were
here at the Harrow School, and the father says that
Percival must win the fourth for the one empty corner
in the drawing-room, or he shall be ashamed to
call him his son!”</p>

<p>Just here the boys were interrupted in their talk,
for the target was ready, and, at a signal, the
contest began. At first, one shot after another
fell quite outside the third circle that surrounded the
bull’s-eye, then came a shaft that glanced just to one
side of the inner circle; but at last, after many fruitless
attempts, the bull’s-eye was fairly pierced, and
the feat was greeted with a gay concert from the
French horns.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened—at least this is one of the
traditions of Harrow—that the name of this last
boy was “Love,” and when his arrow touched the
bulls-eye a number of his school-fellows shouted
high above the horns:</p>

<p>“<i>Omnia vincit Amor!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so!” said another boy who stood close by.
“<i>Nos non cedamus Amori!</i>” And, carefully adjusting
his shaft, he shot it into the bull’s-eye a whole
inch nearer the centre than his rival.</p>

<p>But each boy among the twelve competitors must
have his own trial shot twelve times repeated, before
the final award can be given. Meanwhile a careful
tally is kept, and not until the one hundred and
forty-fourth arrow springs from its bow is the victor’s
name announced:</p>

<p>“Thomas Reginald Percival.”</p>

<p>That first victory seems to have given a magic impulse
to his bow, for all twelve of his arrows have
pierced the charmed inner circle of the target; and
now, at the head of an excited procession of boys, he
is borne triumphantly from the Butts to the village.
One little fellow in white satin runs far ahead, waving
the silver arrow with many flourishes; and, when the
school-buildings of Harrow are reached, a grand reception
is given to all the neighboring country-folk.</p>

<p>Young Percival, with bright eyes and flushed
cheeks, is the hero of the evening. There are
games and dancing, and all sorts of merry-making
until the “wee sma” hours, but the victorious boy
can think of nothing save the coveted arrow he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
won. That empty corner no longer troubles his excited
brain.</p>

<p>He has ably vindicated his right to the old
family name, and henceforward, the father can point
with pride to four trophies, won by his four sons at
the famous Butts of Harrow.</p>

<p>That was in 1766. In 1771 the annual shootings
at Harrow were abolished; for Dr. Heath, who was
then head-master of the school, thought they interfered
with the boys’ studies. The silver arrow prepared
for the following year, 1772, was never used, but
is still preserved at Harrow as a relic of the past. In
the school-library may be seen one of the archer’s
elaborate suits, which is nearly a hundred years old;
and the fourth of August, though no longer an exciting
day at the Butts, is still kept as a holiday at
Harrow School, and commemorated with appropriate
speeches.</p>

<h2><a name="TINY_FEET_OF_CHINESE" id="TINY_FEET_OF_CHINESE">TINY FEET OF CHINESE
LADIES.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">JUST imagine the foot of a full grown lady but five
inches in length! Yet even this is large, and in
highly aristocratic families four inches is the standard.</p>

<p>This queer custom of compressing the feet of
Chinese girls is of very ancient date, and in our day
is almost universal—only nuns, slaves, boat-women,
and others who are obliged to perform out-door drudgery,
being exempt. As to the origin of the custom,
the Chinese themselves are not agreed. Many suppose
that it is a fashion intended to draw a line between the
higher and lower classes. Others say that its object was
to keep <i>ladies</i> within doors, where they would not be
subjected, like common market or boat-women, to the
gaze of the other sex; and some boldly declare that
to cripple them was known to be the only way by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which women could be kept at home, and rendered of
use working for their husbands or fathers, instead of
spending their time in gadding and gossip. Some of
the most reliable native historians state that the custom
began during the reign of Take, somewhere
about the year 1123, with a whim of the last Empress
of the Shang dynasty.</p>

<p>The time for putting on the first bandages varies in
different families. In some, the process is commenced
when the baby is only a few weeks old, others defer
the ceremony for a year or two but all begin before
the little one has reached the age of four years.</p>

<p>No iron or wooden shoe is used, as some travelers
have stated; but a strip of cotton cloth, some three
inches wide, and about six feet long, is wound around
the toes, over the instep, and then behind the heel,
after which it is brought back again over the foot and
drawn so tightly around the toes as to press them into
a point—all except the first and second having been
previously doubled under the sole.</p>

<p>These bandages are never removed, except for
purposes of cleanliness, perhaps once a month; and
they are replaced as quickly as possible, each time
being drawn tighter, until the instep bends into a bow
and the ball of the foot is forced against the heel.</p>

<p>The stockings are made of white cotton or silk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
The dainty little shoes are of silk, richly embroidered
and often beautifully adorned with tiny pearls or
rubies. The soles are of white satin, quilted, and
stiffened with a lining of pasteboard. The heels are
very high and pointed, and the white satin that entirely
covers them, as well as the upturned toes, presents
a pretty contrast to the blue or crimson silk uppers.</p>

<p>White satin seems to us an odd material for shoe
soles; but they are intended only for carpeted floors.</p>

<p>When one of these tiny satin-soled slippers is cast
off as “worn out,” it has probably never for a single
time come in contact with <i>terra firma;</i> and probably
the wearer, when robed in the white slippers for her
last sleep, has not from her infancy had one gleeful
romp out-doors.</p>

<p>This compression produces, during all the years of
childhood, the most excruciating pain, followed at
length by a sort of numbness. I never saw one
of these compressed feet entirely without covering,
but I saw enough when the outer bandages had been
removed to excite both pity and disgust; and a lady
who had seen the bare foot of one of their greatest
belles told me that she had never even conceived of
a spectacle so shockingly revolting as this tiny foot
when divested of all that could hide its deformity.
Although the young lady was full grown, the sole of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
her foot was but three and three-quarters inches in
length. The great toe formed a point that was bent
upwards and backwards, while the heel, of natural
size, seemed by contrast disproportionately large.</p>

<p>Chinese ladies of rank are seldom seen abroad unless
in closely curtained Sedan-chairs; but we used
occasionally to meet those of the middle class making
short excursions in the immediate vicinity of their
homes. Their attempts at walking were pitiable in
the extreme, as they hobbled along, leaning on an umbrella,
or the shoulder of a servant, for support, or
with hands outstretched against the houses as they
passed, endeavoring to keep their balance.</p>

<h2><a name="SHETLAND_PONIES" id="SHETLAND_PONIES">SHETLAND PONIES.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">FAR north from Scotland, and but seldom visited
by southern travelers are the Shetland Islands.
From these rock-bound, treeless islands come the
Shetland ponies that we so often see at the circus,
or pulling little phaetons patiently along. A Shetland
pony is almost a child’s first desire, unless, perhaps,
it may be to own a monkey. To have a pony
to ride, or to drive, and especially a <i>real</i> Shetland,
long-haired, short-legged pony is a dream of perfect
happiness, indeed.</p>

<p>But have the readers of this little sketch ever
thought about the home of these ponies? If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
never have, then take a map of the British Isles, and
in the far North you will see the small group of
islands called the Shetlands, and from there the first
ponies came; and to-day they are raised there in
great numbers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/i-103.jpg" width="242" height="244" alt="pony and boy" />
</div>

<p>Shetland is a very different country than many
see. There are no green fields and trees, and the
children living there hardly believe it when you tell
them that in England or Scotland there are green
lanes, and that birds build nests among green leaves.
All the birds they see, hover about the great, rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
cliffs, and build nests in the crevices of rocks, perhaps
a thousand feet above the sea. All their fields
are covered with black peat or brown heather; and
instead of houses of wood to live in, they only have
huts made of stone with a roof of straw, mud and
refuse wood. In some of the houses there are no
windows, only one room, and a low door. Then there
is no chimney to let the smoke out, but only a small
hole in the roof. Of course these huts are for the
very poor people living out among the hills of Shetland,
and away from the coast. But near the sea, on
the shores of some secluded bay, are quite good
towns, such as Lerwick and Scolloway. These towns
have little stone houses with very pointed roofs and
deep-set windows, that almost seem to rest in the
water itself, they are built so near it. Then the
streets are very narrow, and have been paved with
great stones. You can almost touch either side of
the street it is so narrow.</p>

<p>Now the people of the Shetland Islands are very
quiet, orderly and industrious. They live by many
means. Some of them have shops in the towns,
where they sell groceries, and dress-goods and cured
meats. Others live by catching fish to send south.
Some let themselves down by ropes over the edge of
a great high cliff, and gather the eggs of birds. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the women knit shawls and hoods and veils and
socks, and so gain a few pennies to buy food
with. But there is yet another class of people
who have to make a living, and this class raise ponies
and sheep, to send to England and even to America.
And before we speak or describe carefully the making
of shawls and gathering of eggs, we will imagine ourselves
in the town of Lerwick and all ready for a
start to Noss Island, where a man lives who has a large
herd of real Shetland ponies.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/i-106.jpg" width="332" height="341" alt="Three ponies and farm in background" />
<div class="caption">SHETLAND PONIES.</div>
</div>

<p>I remember the morning perfectly. The bay
was all dotted with the white sails of the fishing
boats. The town was all awake carrying dried fish
to the boats at anchor, and on the corners of the
streets were gathered women and young girls selling
potatoes they had just brought in from the distant
field. We took a row boat, and rowed across Bressay
Sound to Bressay Island, and then walking across it,
and after looking back at the town and out at sea, we
came to a small strait, and had to hire another boat
to take us across the water to Noss Island. This
island is not very large, but has more green grass than
any other of the Shetland group. One end of it almost
buries itself in the sea, and then it gradually
rises higher and higher, until the opposite end rises a
thousand feet right up from the sea. There is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
one house on the island, and in that lives the keeper
of the ponies and his two children. I wish you could
have seen these children when they saw us coming
in the boat. They hardly ever leave the island
themselves, and so when any strangers come to see
their ponies, how happy it makes them! They were
very pretty and bright children, too. They had light
hair and bright blue eyes, and cheeks as red as roses.
Running down with them, was their pet dog, who
seemed just as glad as any of the rest to see strangers.
The house the man lived in was very lonely-looking
to us. It was built of stone, and then painted white,
and stood on a little knoll overlooking the blue
waters of the cold North Sea.</p>

<p>After a short rest we walked out to explore the
island and see the ponies. Here was their home
and we should see them here in their real life. As
we walked along, we came to a part of the island
where it was rather sandy, and there found such a
nest of rabbits. We almost stumbled into their
holes, there were so many of them when we came
upon them. There must have been fully a hundred
nibbling the short grass, or standing up to see who
was coming to disturb them. The keeper said they
were a great nuisance to the island, they undermined
it so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>But a sight that interested us more than that of the
rabbits was the great herd of ponies we saw before
us.</p>

<p>There must have been fully two hundred of the
shaggy-maned little fellows. Some were eating, some
biting one another, some running as though having a
race, and others stood still looking at us. When we
came nearer the whole herd pricked up their ears,
gave little snorts of anger, and galloped away as fast
as their short legs could carry them.</p>

<p>The keeper told us that when one wishes a pony,
to ride or sell, he must take the one he keeps near
his house, mount him, and then riding out to the
herd, lassoo one at a time until you obtain all
you wish. In winter the ponies of Noss Island have
rather a hard time of it. Though there is not much
snow on the island, still the winds often blow very
fiercely, and poor pony has no warm barn to go to.
Sometimes the keeper builds a wall about a square
piece of ground, and pony can go into the enclosure
and so be somewhat sheltered. But usually he must
face the wind and storm, no matter what the weather.</p>

<p>Among the ponies we saw on our visit, were some
little wee fellows, hardly larger than Newfoundland
dogs. When we saw them scampering about so free
from care, we couldn’t help wondering how long it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
would be before they would be carrying some little
lady up and down Rotten Row, or about New York
Central Park. The case is not unlikely, for a great
many of them each year are sent away from their
island home to England.</p>

<p>But a pony in the Shetland Islands, even, has often
hard work to perform. If a poor person is possessed
of a pony, then, indeed, he feels rich. Now on
certain days in the week, there are market days at
Lerwick. From all about come the people bringing
things to sell. Some walk to the town, some sail, and
others come riding on their ponies. Just inside of
Lerwick is a narrow path leading over the hills. I
have often seen, coming along this narrow way, a long
line of ponies and women. And such a curious appearance
they present! The ponies seem only legs.
They have no bridle, only a cord about the neck, and
each follows the one in front. You can’t make them
go at the side of one another. On either side of each
one are two immense saddle-bags filled with peat, or
potatoes; on his back are piled other goods, and
even his neck has a cloth or other saddle-bags
strapped, so that seen from a short distance it seems
just as though the bags had legs, and poor pony
seems buried out of sight. Sometimes, too, if there
is room to keep seated, his mistress, with shoeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
feet, and short dress and white cap, seats herself in
great state, and away goes pony, bags and woman, off
to Lerwick. Sometimes, when on these pilgrimages,
pony will watch his chance, and if his mistress should
be absent, will dart away down the steep hill-side, to
nibble a bite of something good he has seen; and
then when the mistress sees him such a pounding as
pony gets as she leads him back to his proper place!
But he only looks meek and will no doubt do the
same thing again when he gets the chance.</p>

<p>Shetland ponies are very sure-footed. They will
walk along the very edge of a high cliff, and before
putting a foot down will carefully feel if the ground
is firm or not. Some of them are driven by their
riders down steep passes where one misstep would
send both rider and pony down to the depths below.
Ponies of Shetland, too, are not always very well behaved.
Near our cottage was an old lady’s garden,
filled with cabbages. One day her pony walked
into it, and enjoyed himself feasting on forbidden
fruit. We never asked him, but should imagine the
beating he received when discovered would help him
to digest his stolen dinner. Then a Shetland pony on
his native heath is extremely wilful. If they dislike
a rider they will spare no pains to unseat him. I rode
one once who expended a great deal of unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
strength in this manner. He would sit down suddenly
and rise up more so. He would bite, shake
himself and roll over, if allowed. As he was almost
small enough to be carried by his rider, these antics
were more amusing than dangerous.</p>

<p>And so the ponies of the Shetland Islands live and
wait for masters in the South. In the cold winter of
fog and rain, when there is almost no day, or in the
summer time, when the sun does not set, they run
wild about the Noss, take burdens to Lerwick, or
carry the stranger over the bogs and dreary hills.</p>

<h2><a name="MR_SWEET_POTATOES" id="MR_SWEET_POTATOES">MR. SWEET POTATOES.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">OUR milkman has a very odd name,—translated
into English it is “Sweet Potatoes.” His Chinese
neighbors call him “Old Father Sweet Potatoes.”</p>

<p>Some persons think him a good man; others say
that he is a very bad one. Just how that is I do not
know—his business brings him great temptation.</p>

<p>He is accused of putting water into the milk. He
himself says, that he only does it when he has not
enough milk to supply all his customers; then he
does not know what else he <i>can</i> do. When we engaged
him to bring milk to us we took him into our
yard and showed him that we had a well of our own.</p>

<p>The Chinese in their own country do not make any
use of milk or butter. They have a perfect horror of
cheese, and in this part of China, perhaps, not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
than one man in a hundred will taste of beef. Only
a few cows and bullocks are kept, and these are
needed to plough the fields and turn the rude machinery
of the sugar mills.</p>

<p>I suppose “Father Sweet Potatoes” had never
thought of such a thing as owning a cow, until foreign
ships began to come to his part of the country.
Of course the ships brought foreign men and women,
and these all wanted beef to eat—sometimes the
Chinese, wishing to speak contemptuously of them,
would call them “beef-eating foreigners,”—and they
also wanted milk for their cooking and for their children.</p>

<p>So Mr. Sweet Potatoes bought some cows, hoping
to make some money in the milk business. They all
had long ropes laced about their horns or threaded
through their noses, and he got some little children
to hold the ropes and guide the cows in search of
food; for there are no grass fields in this part of the
country, and all the pastures the cows have are the
little green places on the rocky hills and the grassy
patches along the brooks; and the children sit by
and watch them while they graze, for there are no
fences, and, left to themselves, the cows might stray
into the rice fields or wander away into places where
they would be stolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange to say, we have our best milk when the
winter has almost killed the grass, or when the
weather is too stormy for the cows to go out; for
then they are fed with the tops of pea-nut plants,
either green, or dried like hay, and up for sale in
great bundles. This is delicious food for the cows,
and when they have it then we have good milk indeed,
with a thick, white cream upon it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/i-115.jpg" width="296" height="243" alt="man and boy looking at cow and calf" />
<div class="caption">HE NATIVE HUMPBACK COW.</div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes they have cut grass to eat, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
been brought from steep places on the hills to which
the cows cannot go. Very poor boys go out with
baskets and knives to gather this grass, and are paid
only three or four cents for the work of a day.</p>

<p>Mr. Sweet Potatoes has two kinds of cows. Some
of them are the native humpback cows, of very small
size, very gentle; sometimes red and sometimes
brown, with hair that is smooth and glossy quite
down to the tiny little hoofs, which look far smaller
and cleaner than do the feet of cows in colder climates
where they walk out in snow and stand in
frosty barns.</p>

<p>These cows have very small horns, sometimes
three or four inches long, but often mere little white
buds coming out from their dark foreheads. Back of
their shoulders they have a small hump, three or four
inches high. And, almost always, Sweet Potatoes’
cows have with them a pretty, little, sprightly calf;
for the Chinese believe, or pretend to believe, that if
the calf were taken away the cow would die, and that
it is necessary before milking her to first let the calf
have a few mouthfuls of milk,—poor little calf!</p>

<p>The other cows are very different from these; they
are water buffaloes,—buffaloes not at all like the
shaggy bison, but great, awkward creatures, that in
summer like to wade into pools, and, safe from flies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and mosquitos, to stand with only their horns and
upturned faces in sight above the top of the water;
or, when there are no pools, to wander into bogs and
half bury themselves in the mud. They are as large
as a big ox, with very round bodies mounted on very
slim legs that have very large knee and ankle joints.
They are of the color of a mouse, or a gray pig, and
coarse hairs grow thinly over their skin, while, in
contrast to the humpback cows, they have two immense,
crescent-shaped horns setting up from their
heads, and measuring often a yard from side to side.</p>

<p>Old Father Sweet Potatoes sells ten pint-bottles
full for a silver dollar,—that is ten cents a pint,—and
in summer he brings us a half-pint in the morning
and another half-pint in the afternoon; for the
weather is so hot that the milk of the morning will
not remain sweet until evening, although the moment
it is brought to the house it is boiled and then put in
the coolest place we have, which is not a cellar, for
cellars cannot be kept sweet and airy in countries
where there is so much moisture and many insects.</p>

<p>When, in our walks, we meet these cows they often
exhibit fear, especially of foreign ladies and horses,
sights with which they are not familiar. The little
humpback cows prance skittishly out of the paths;
but the great buffaloes, stand quite still and stare at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
us, then throw up their noses and sniff the air in an
offended manner that in turn makes us afraid of them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/i-118.jpg" width="292" height="244" alt="buffalo in flooding waters with boy on its back" />
<div class="caption">THE WATER-BUFFALO.</div>
</div>

<p>At night they are all brought home from their wanderings,
and the ropes by which they are led are tied
to stakes driven into the ground; in winter under a
shed, but in summer in the open air. It makes one’s
neck ache to see them; for the rope is frequently tied
so short that they cannot hold their heads erect nor
move them very freely, but they do not appear to suffer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to his business the milkman values his daughter,
who, when I first saw her, was a plump, rosy-cheeked
child and tended her father’s cows. If you
ever saw a doll with a plaster head that had been
broken and then had been mended by having a strip
of black silk glued over the crack, you will know
how Mr. Sweet Potatoes’ daughter looked.</p>

<p>She wore a piece of black crape bound tightly
about her head so that no one could see her hair.
Some persons said that, owing to illness, she had no
hair. If so it must have grown afterwards; for,
when she was older and had left tending the cows,
she had it put up on her head with pins, in a strange
fashion that showed she was going to be married.</p>

<p>Sweet Potatoes had no son and he wished his son-in-law
to come and live with him as if he belonged
to him. Among the Chinese this is not considered
so honorable or so genteel, as to have the daughter
leave her home and go and live with her husband’s
family. It seemed strange that the son-in-law should
consent; for though he was very poor he was also
very proud, and was very particular to have respect
shown to him and in regard to the kinds of work that
he was willing to do. I should never have guessed
his foolish reason for being so proud, but some one
told me that it was because his father, now dead, had
once held a small office in the Custom House!</p>

<h2><a name="SHETLAND_WOMEN" id="SHETLAND_WOMEN">SHETLAND WOMEN.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">NOT far outside the town of Lerwick, on the
Shetland Islands there is a great, black,
muddy tract of land called a peat-bog. All about is
utter desolation. There are no huts even to be seen.
The town is concealed by a rounded hill; and when,
through some opening between the bare upheavals,
one catches a sight of the North Sea, it, too, seems
deserted by mankind.</p>

<p>The peat, or mixture of roots and peculiar black
soil, is dug here in large quantities; and all about the
place are great piles of it, dried and ready to be
burned in the fire-places of the Lerwick people.
Peat takes the place of wood; and in every poor
man’s hut in Shetland will it be found burning
brightly, and giving out a thin blue smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>To prepare peat for market, a great deal of labor
is performed. First come the diggers—men, women
and children. Entering upon the deep, miry bogs
they cut the soil up into cakes about a foot long
and a few inches thick; and these they place in high
piles to dry. After a few weeks they come again,
and carry the cured fuel away to the town.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 522px;">
<img src="images/i-122.jpg" width="522" height="274" alt="men in boat yelling to people on shore" />
<div class="caption">COAST OF SHETLAND</div>
</div>

<p>It is while carrying these loads that the Shetlanders
present a peculiar spectacle. The men are
often very old, infirm and poorly clothed; and the
women are dressed in short-skirted, home-spun
gowns, below which may be seen very red and very
broad feet. On their heads they usually have
white caps, nicely ironed, with a fluted ruffle around
the edge. Passing across the breast and over either
shoulder are two strong straps, and these support
an immense basket hanging against the back.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, the brave, stout women, their baskets
piled with peat, tramp off to Lerwick, two miles
away, to sell their loads for a few pennies each.
They make many trips a day, always smiling, chatting
and apparently contented. Often a long line
may be seen carefully stepping along over the rough
roads, stopping now and then to rest.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/i-124.jpg" width="296" height="347" alt="two women with packs" />
<div class="caption">SHETLAND WOMEN.</div>
</div>

<p>The homes of these poor peat women are, many
of them, simply hovels. When they wish to build a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
home, they go out into some fields, usually far away
from other huts, and there they dig a trench about a
square piece of ground. Upon this they build walls
to a height of about eight feet, and fill the crevices
with mud and bog. For a roof they gather refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
sea-wood, and, with this for a support, lay on layer
after layer of straw, mud and stones.</p>

<p>But what homes they seem to us! There is no
fire-place, only a hole in the ground, with a hole in
the roof for the smoke to escape through! No windows,
the door serving for both light and entrance!
No beds, only heaps of straw! Sometimes in one
small room, often the only one the house contains,
will be seen man, wife, children, dog and hens, equal
occupants, sharing the same rude comforts. Outside
the house, if the owner be moderately well off, may
be seen a herd of sheep or ponies, and a patch of
garden surrounded by a wall.</p>

<p>But there is something a peat woman of Shetland is
continually doing that we have not yet noticed. All
have no doubt heard of Shetland hosiery; of the fine,
warm shawls and hoods, and delicate veils that come
from these far northern islands. Now, all the while the
poor, bare-legged woman is carrying her heavy burden
of peat, her hands are never idle. She is knitting,
knitting away as fast as her nimble fingers will
allow. In her pocket is the ball of yarn, and as her
needles fly back and forth, she weaves fabrics of such
fineness that the Royal ladies of England wear them;
and no traveller visits the island without loading his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
trunk with shawls, mittens, stockings, and other feminine
fancies.</p>

<p>Not to know how to knit in Shetland is like not
knowing how to read at home. A little girl is taught
the art before she can read; and, as a result, at every
cottage will be found the spinning-wheel and the needles,
while the feminine hands are never idle. It is
one great means of support; and on Regent Street
in London will be seen windows full of soft, white
goods marked “Shetland Hosiery.”</p>

<p>Who first instructed these far northern people in this
delicate art is not surely known. On Fair Isle, one of
the Shetland group, the art is first said to have been
discovered, very many years ago. On that lonely isle
even now, every woman, girl and child knits while
working at any of her various duties.</p>

<p>The yarn with which the Shetland goods are made
is spun from the wool of the sheep we see roaming
about the fields. In almost every cottage may be
seen the veritable old-fashioned wheel; and the busy
girl at the treadle sends the great wheel flying, and
spins out the long skeins, which serve to make baby
pretty hood or grandma a warm shawl.</p>

<h2><a name="MARDI_GRAS_IN_NICE" id="MARDI_GRAS_IN_NICE">MARDI GRAS IN NICE.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">HAVE you ever happened in Nice at Carnival?</p>

<p>On a bright June morning, which my calendar
called February twelfth, Rull and I tripped lightly
down through the old olive orchards to the station,
and billeted ourselves for Nice.</p>

<p>Long before we reached Nice Rull’s hands tingled;
for there lay a beautiful line of snow, miles
away, on the <i>north</i> side of the Alps, and the poor
fellow hadn’t been as near a snow-ball as that for the
winter. But I had only to say “<i>confetti!</i>” and his
eyes danced at the vision of the parti-colored hail-storm
to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Now hasten with us at once to the <i>Promenade du
Cours</i>, up and down which the procession is to
pass.</p>

<p>First, however, I shall buy for you each a little
blue gauze mask; for you cannot even peep at Carnival
unmasked. And if any of you can wear linen
dusters with hoods attached, all the better. Don’t
leave a square inch of skin unprotected, I warn you.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-129.jpg" width="600" height="179" alt="" />
<div class="caption">“PROMENADE DU COURS,” IN CARNIVAL TIME.</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the little masks, you may buy, each of you, a
whole bushel of these “sugar-plums,” and have them
sent to our balcony. Also for each a little tin scoop
fastened on a flexible handle, which you are to fill
with <i>confetti</i> but on no account to pull—at least, not
yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The crowds are gathering. Pretty peasant girls in
their holiday attire of bright petticoats, laced
bodices, and white frilled caps; stray dominoes;
richly dressed ladies with mask in hand; carriages
so decorated with flowers as to be artistically hidden—even
the wheels covered with batiste—blue, pink,
purple, green or buff. Even the sidewalk, as we
pass, is fringed with chairs at a franc each.</p>

<p>The “<i>Cours</i>” is gay with suspended banners, bright
with festooned balconies and merry faces. Sidewalks
and street are filled with people; but the
horses have the right of way, and the people are
fined if they are run over.</p>

<p>Let us hasten to our balcony, for here passes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
band of musicians, in scarlet and gold, to open the
procession.</p>

<p>Just in time we take our seats, and lo! before us
rolls a huge car.</p>

<p>It is “the theatre”—an open car of puppets—but
the puppets are <i>men;</i> all attached to cords held
in the hand of the giant, who sits in imposing state
above them on the top of the car which is on a
level with the third story balconies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-131.jpg" width="600" height="174" alt="parade" />
<div class="caption">“PROMENADE DU COURS,” IN CARNIVAL TIME.</div>
</div>

<p>The giant lifts his hand and the puppets whirl and
jump. But alas! his head is too high. His hat is
swept off by the hanging festoons, and the giant must
ride bare-headed, in danger of sunstroke.</p>

<p>Next behind the car moves in military order a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
regiment of mounted grasshoppers. Their sleek, shining
bodies of green satin, their gauzy wings and
antennæ, snub noses and big eyes, are all absolutely
perfect to the eye; but—they are of the size of men.</p>

<p>You lower your mask to see more clearly, you are
lost in wonder at the perfect illusion, your mouth is
wide open with “Ohs!” and “Ahs!” when <i>pop!</i>
<i>pop!</i> slings a shower of <i>confetti</i>, and the little hail-stones
seem to cut off your ears and rush sifting
down your neck.</p>

<p>For, while you were watching the grasshoppers, a
low open carriage, concealed under a pink and white
cover, has stopped under our windows. Four merry
masqueraders, cloaked and hooded in hue to match,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
have a bushel of <i>confetti</i> between them, and are piled
with nosegays. We slink behind our masks, we pull
the handles of our <i>confetti</i> scoops—then the battle
begins and waxes fierce.</p>

<p>But they are crowded on; for behind them, in irresistible
stateliness, moves on the Sun and Moon.
Then come the Seasons: Winter represented by a
band of Russians, fur-covered from top to toe, dragging
a Siberian sledge. Summer is recognized by a
car-load of choicest flowers, whose fragrance reaches
us as they pass.</p>

<div class="caption">“PROMENADE DU COURS,” IN CARNIVAL TIME.</div>
</div>

<p>Here rolls a huge wine cask which fills half the
wide street; there moves a pine cone, six feet high,
to the eye perfectly like the cones, six inches in length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
which we use daily to light our olive-wood fire.</p>

<p>Then a procession of giant tulips—stalk, calyx,
petals, all complete. They also silently move on.</p>

<p>Next a huge pot, with a cat climbing its side, her
paw just thrust beneath the lid. Ha! it suddenly
flies off. Does the cat enter? We cannot see
through the crowd. A colossal stump follows, trailing
with mosses and vines. Upon it a bird’s nest
filled with young, their mouths wide open for food;
wonderful, because the artistic skill is so perfect that,
although so immense, they seem living and not
unnatural.</p>

<p>Then a car of Arctic bears champing to and fro
in the heat, poor things, as well they may; for this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a cloudless sky and an Italian sun. Look carefully
at them and tell me, are they not true bears?</p>

<p>But ah! <i>sling!</i> <i>sling!</i> two handfuls of <i>confetti</i> sting
your eyes back into place again, and dash the bears
out of sight. Isn’t it delightfully unbearable? You
shout at the folly of having forgotten <i>confetti</i>, and
then resolve to watch your chance at the next poor
foot-pad.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-134.jpg" width="600" height="170" alt="end of parad at last" />
<div class="caption">“PROMENADE DU COURS” IN CARNIVAL TIME.</div>
</div>

<p>Here passes a man with two faces. His arms are
neatly folded before, also behind. You cannot tell
which is the real front, until, suddenly, a horse trots up
and nearly touches noses, while the man moves on
undisturbed. You meant to give that man a dash,
but you forgot, he was so queer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah! here comes a carriage of pretty girls. Down
pours the shot from the balcony above. It rains on
you like hail. It runs in rills down your back. You
hold your recovered ears, and add your tone to the
rippling, rippling laughter that flows on in silvery
tide.</p>

<p>Not one boisterous shout, not one impatient exclamation
the whole livelong day; only everywhere the
sound of childish glee. How good to see even old
careworn faces lighted up with mirth!</p>

<p>Here goes an ostrich with a monkey on his back
then a man with a whole suit of clothes neatly fitted
out of Journals.</p>

<p>But—look! look! there towers a huge car. Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
it is a basket—a vegetable basket! but its sides are
as high as our balcony. On its corners stand white
carrots with their green waving tops upward.
Around the edges are piled a variety of garden beauties.</p>

<p>But, wonderful to see, in the centre rises a mammoth
cabbage. Its large-veined petals are as perfect
as any you ever saw in your garden, but their tips
reach above the third balcony. Upon these veined
petals climb gorgeous butterflies, whose wings slowly
shut and open while they sip. As the mammoth
passes, the outer petals slowly droop, and snails are
seen clinging within, while gayly-hued butterflies
creep into view.</p>

<p>Now the carriages mingle gayly in the procession.
Here is one with young lads, their faces protected
with gauze masks, which laughably show shut red
lips without, and two red lines of lips and white glittering
teeth within. The battle of <i>confetti</i> waxes hot.
Merry faces fill all balconies and windows. Many a
beauty drops her mask for an instant like ourselves
to peer more eagerly at the wonderful procession, but
at her peril. On the instant <i>dash!</i> <i>dash!</i> flies the
<i>confetti</i>, slung with force enough from the little scoops
to sting sharply.</p>

<p>War is the fiercest yonder where there is such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
handsome family (Americans we are sure), father,
mother and daughter.</p>

<p>Here goes a carriage decorated with United States
flags; all its occupants cloaked and hooded in gray
linen, the carriage covered likewise. They stop
beneath the balcony, and <i>sling!</i> <i>sling!</i> <i>sling!</i> in wildest
combat until crowded on.</p>

<p>Up and down the procession sweeps. Up one
side the wide “<i>Cours</i>” and down the other; the space
within filled with the merry surging crowd, under
the feet of the horses it would seem. But no matter.
Horses and men and women and children bear
a charmed life to-day.</p>

<p>Now and then a policeman pounces on the boys,
who are gathering up the heaps of <i>confetti</i> from the
dirt to sell again; but this is the only suggestion of
law and order behind the gay confusion.</p>

<p>Here rolls a carriage trimmed with red and white.
Within are a pair of scarlet dominoes, who peer mysteriously
at you.</p>

<p>But look again at what moves on. A car longer
than any yet seen.</p>

<p>It is a grotto. Within its cool recesses bask
immense lizards. Some slowly climb its sides, then,
in search of prey, thrust out their long tongues. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
shining coat, in color, in movement, you would avow
them to be lizards, truly. But how huge!</p>

<p>Behind the lizards pass again the mounted grasshoppers,
our favorites of all, for their wonderfully
perfect form and dainty beauty. And lo! they bear,
to our delight, a silken banner, token of the prize.</p>

<p>For, pets, do you read between the lines and
understand that this wonderful procession was the
result of truly artistic skill?—that to imitate perfectly
to the eye, to represent exactly in motion all
these living creatures, and yet conceal within a boy
or man who invisibly moved them, required all the
delicacy of perception and nicety of workmanship of
French eyes and fingers? Think you that your little
fingers and bright eyes will ever attain so much.</p>

<p>Besides, all this was also a great outlay of thousands
of francs. For Nice aroused herself to excel
in Carnival, and offered large prizes—one of five
thousand francs, another of four, another of three—for
the most perfect representations.</p>

<p>Nowhere in Italy was there anything to compare
with Nice. And I doubt if you would see again in
Carnival what would so perfectly delight your young
eyes, or so quicken your perception of artistic skill.</p>

<p>We look at our watches. Two hours yet; but we
long to taste the fun on foot. So we fling our last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<i>confetti</i>, fill hair and button-holes and hands with
our sweet nosegays of geranium, sweet alyssum,
mignonette and pansies—mementoes of the fight,—then
descend to the sidewalk to press our way
along the crowded court.</p>

<p>More and more to see! and, last of all, Carnival
tossed and tumbled in effigy until his death by
drowning or burning.</p>

<p>But we must be early at the station. Early,
indeed! Peppered and pelted all the way, tweaked
and shot at; but ever and always with <i>only</i> the harmless
<i>confetti</i> and soft nosegays.</p>

<p>Sure that we are the first to leave, sure that no
others are there before us, we pass into the outer
baggage-room. Fifty more are there pressed hard
against the closed door.</p>

<p>The crowd swells; hundreds are behind us; we
can scarcely keep our feet. Yet what a good-natured
crowd! The hour for the train to leave passes. By
and by the closed door opens a crack; a gilt-banded
arm is thrust through and <i>one</i> person taken out, and
the solemn door closed again.</p>

<p>So, one by one, we ooze through, pass the turnstile
in the passage under surveillance of the keen-eyed
officer, and are admitted into the saloon, which
is also locked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>We sink down into a seat nearest <i>the</i> one of two
doors which instinct tells us is to be opened. Again
we wait an hour till the last panting victim is passed
through the stile.</p>

<p>Then, O! it is not our door which unlocks and
opens but the other. We rush for a compartment;
but no! all appear filled, so we step to an official
and state our case.</p>

<p>He conducts us on, on, nearly to the end of the
train, over stones and timbers; but, at last, bestows
us out of that crowd in a compartment with but three
persons. Soon we leave, only two hours later than
the time advertised.</p>

<p>For in France, little pets, the trains wait for the
people. The people are locked in till all is ready;
then follows a rush like a grand game of “puss,
puss in the corner!” and almost always there is
some poor puss who cannot get in.</p>

<p>Guess how many bushels of <i>confetti</i> rattled on the
floor of our chamber that night!</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_FARM_IN_WINTER" id="ON_THE_FARM_IN_WINTER">ON THE FARM IN WINTER.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE life of a boy in winter on the old-fashioned
New England farm seems to me one of the
best of the right kinds of life for a healthy lad, provided
his tastes have not been spoiled by wrong
reading, or by some misleading glimpse of a city by
gas-light. It certainly abounds with the blood and
muscle-making sports for which the city physiologists
so anxiously strive to substitute rinks and gymnasiums.</p>

<p>But I rather pity a young fellow who gets his only
sleigh rides by paying a dollar an hour to the livery-stable,
and who must do his skating within limits on
artificial ice. He never gets even a taste of such
primitive fun as two boys I know had last winter.
The sleigh was at the wagon-maker’s shop for repairs
when the first heavy snow fell, and they harnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Dobbin to an old boat, and had an uproarious ride up
hill and down dale, with glorious bumps and jolts.</p>

<p>I rather pity a fellow, too, who eats grocer’s apples,
and confectioner’s nuts, and baker’s cream cakes,
who never knows the fun of going down cellar to the
apple bins to fill his pockets for school, and who
owns no right in a pile of butternuts on the garret
floor. I am sorry for a boy that knows nothing of
the manly freedom of trowsers tucked in boots, hands
and feet both cased in home-knit mittens and home-knit
socks—I cannot believe his blood is as red, or
can possibly flow so deep and strong in his sidewalk
sort of life, as the young fellows who chop
wood and ply the snow-shovel, and turn out <i>en masse</i>
with snow-ploughs after a long storm—the sound of
the future strength of the land is in the sturdy stamp
of their snowy boots at the door as they come in
from their hearty work. I am not writing of country
boys that want to be clerks,—they are spoiled for
fun anyhow,—but of the boys that expect, if they
expect anything in particular, to stay on the farm
and own it themselves some day.</p>

<p>This stinging cold morning the boys at the school-house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
door are not discussing the play-bills of the
<i>Globe</i> or the <i>Museum</i>, but how the river froze last
night, turning the long quiet surface to blue-black
ice, as smooth as a looking-glass. Now what skating!
what grand noonings, what glorious evenings! No
rink or frog-pond, where one no sooner gets under
headway than he must turn about, but miles and
miles of curving reaches leading him forward between
rustling sedges, till he sees the white caps of
the open lake dancing before him.</p>

<p>Presently the snow comes and puts an end to the
sport; for sweeping miles and miles of ice is out of
the question. After the snow, a thaw; and then the
jolly snow-balling. There is not enough of a thaw
to take the snow off; only enough to make it just
sufficiently sloppy and soft for the freeze-up that
follows to give it a crust almost as hard and smooth
as the ice lately covered up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 556px;">
<img src="images/i-144.jpg" width="556" height="352" alt="sleigh pulled by horse going through woods" />
<div class="caption">THE IMPROVISED SLEIGH.</div>
</div>

<p>Then such coasting! Just think of dragging
your sled of a moonlight night up a mile of easy
tramping to the foot of the mountain, whence you
come down again, now fast, now slow, now “like a
streak” down a sharp incline, now running over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
even-rail fence buried in the glittering drifts, and
bringing up at last at a neighbor’s door, or at the back
side of your own barnyard!</p>

<p>It is great fun, too, to slide on the drifts with
“slews” or “jumpers.” These are made sometimes
of one, sometimes of two barrel-staves, and are sure
to give you many a jolly bump and wintersault.</p>

<p>There is fun to be had <i>in</i> the drifts too, digging
caves or under-snow houses, wherein you may build
a fire without the least danger. Here you can be
Esquimaux, and your whole tribe sally forth from the
igloë and attack a terrible white bear, if one of the
party will kindly consent to be a bear for awhile.
You can make him white enough by pelting him with
snow, and he will <i>bear</i> enough before he is finally killed.</p>

<p>There is fun, too, and of no mean order, to be got
out of the regular farm duties. Not much, perhaps,
out of bringing in the wood, or feeding the
pigs, or turning the fanning-mill; but foddering
the sheep and calves, which, very likely, are pets,
takes the boys to the hay-mow, where odors of
summer linger in the herds-grass, and the daisy
and clover-tops are almost as green and white and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
yellow and purple as when they fell before the scythe.</p>

<p>What a place is this elastic floor for a “wrestle or a
summersault!” and then, who “da’s’t” climb to the
big beam, into the neighborhood of the empty swallows
nests and dusty cobwebs, and take the flying jump
therefrom to the mow? Here, too, are hens’ nests to be
found, with frost-cracked eggs to carry in rats, and
larger prey, also to be hunted when the hay is so
nearly spent that the fork sticks into the loose boards
at the bottom of the hay.</p>

<p>But of all things which the farmer’s boy is wanted
to do, and wants to do, there is nothing such clear fun
as the breaking of a yoke of calves. First, the
little yoke is to be got on to the pair somehow
and a rope made fast to the “nigh” one’s head,
that is, the calf on the left side, where the driver
goes. Then comes bawling and hauling and pushing,
and often too much beating, until the little
cattle are made to understand that “Gee” means
turn to the right, and “Haw” means turn to
the left, and that “Whoa” means stop, and “Back”
means, of them all, just what is said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i-148.jpg" width="355" height="491" alt="playing in the barn. Horse looks on" />
<div class="caption">UPON THE HAY-MOW.</div>
</div>

<p>Every command is roared and shouted; for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
idea seems to prevail that oxen, big and little, are
deaf as adders, and can never be made to hear except
at the top of the voice. In a still winter day, you
may hear a grown-up ox-teamster roaring at his
patient beasts two miles away; and a calf-breaker
not half his size may be heard more than half as far.
Then, on some frosty Saturday, when the little nubby-horned
fellows have learned their lessons, they are
hitched to a sled, and made to haul light loads, a
little wood, or some of the boys,—the driver still
holding to the rope, and flourishing his whip as grand
as a drum-major.</p>

<p>Once in a while the little oxen of the future take
matters into their own hoofs and make a strike for
freedom, upsetting the sled and scattering its load,
and dragging their driver headlong through the snow.</p>

<p>But they have to submit at last; and three or four
years hence, you would never think from their solemn
looks and sober pace that they ever had thought of
such rebellious freaks. They were the boy’s calves,
but father’s oxen.</p>

<p>Halter-breaking a colt is almost as good as breaking
steers, only there is no sled-riding to be had in this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Till lately, the young fellow has had the freedom
of the fields, digging in the first snows for a part
of his living, and with his rough life has grown as
shaggy-coated as a Shetland pony, with as many
burrs stuck in his short foretop as it will hold; for
if there is an overlooked burdock on all the farm,
every one of the horse kind running at large will find
it, and each get more than his share of burrs matted
and twisted into his foretop and mane.</p>

<p>Now, he is waxed and driven into a shed or
stable, and fooled or forced to put his head into a
long, stout, rope halter. Then he is got into the
clear, open meadow, and his first lesson begins.
The boys all lay hold of the rope at a safe distance
from the astonished pupil, and pull steadily upon
him. Just now he would rather go any way than
straight ahead, and holds back with all his might,
looking, with all his legs braced forward, his neck
stretched to its utmost, and his head on a line with
it, like a stubborn little donkey who has lost something
in ears, but nothing in willfulness, and gained
a little in tail. At last he yields a little to the uncomfortable
strain, and takes a few reluctant steps forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
then rears and plunges and throws himself, and
is drawn struggling headlong through the snow, until
he tires of such rough usage and flounders to his feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 529px;">
<img src="images/i-152.jpg" width="529" height="340" alt="calf breaking sled because he's not enjoying the game" />
<div class="caption">BREAKING THE CALVES.</div>
</div>

<p>Then he repeats his bracing tactics, the boys
bracing as stoutly against him, till he suddenly gives
way and they go tumbling all in a heap.</p>

<p>If the boys tire out before the colt gives up, there
are other days coming, and sooner or later he submits;
and in part compensation for not having his
own way, he has a warm stall in the barn, and eats
from a manger, just like a big horse, and is petted
and fondled, and grows to be great friends with his
young masters—at last to be “father’s horse,” instead
of “our colt.”</p>

<p>But by and by the long winter—this play-day
of the year for the farm-boy—comes to an end,
to make way for spring—spring which brings to
him work out of all reasonable proportion to the
amount of play, at least so the farm-boy is likely to
think.</p>

<h2><a name="A_CHINAMANS_QUEUE" id="A_CHINAMANS_QUEUE">A CHINAMAN’S QUEUE.</a></h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/i-160b.jpg" width="176" height="181" alt="Couple from China" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERYONE knows
that a Chinaman
wears his hair in a
queue, but not everyone
knows why he
does so. A Chinaman’s
queue is not a
mere oddity or variety;
it is, to him, a very
serious thing; losing
it, he would almost sell his respectability, and history
tells of more than one time when it has been a matter
of life and death.</p>

<p>In many of their customs the people of China follow
their forefathers of more than a thousand years
ago, but queues may be called a new fashion, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
only been worn about two hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>In very old times, the Chinese wore their long hair
put up in a peculiar manner upon the tops of their
heads, and called themselves “The Black-Haired
Race;” but about the time that the Pilgrims landed
at Plymouth, in the year 1627, the Tartars, who had
come down from Manchuria, and, after long wars,
had conquered China, which they have governed ever
since, made a law that all the Chinese, to show that
they had been conquered, should take down their
top-knots, and wear their hair as the Tartars did, in a
hanging braid; and they threatened to kill all who
would not do it.</p>

<p>Of course the Chinese were greatly distressed by
this; but, as it was better to have a tail than to be
without a head, they submitted in the end, making
the best of what they could not help.</p>

<p>The people of southern China held out longest
against the queue, and, in one district, men were hired
to wear it. Even now, dwelling among the hills, are
a few men belonging to a very old and wild tribe,
whose pride it is that they have never worn hanging
hair; while the Amoy men, who were the very last to
yield to the Tartars, wear a turban to hide the shaven
head, and the detested tail; but some persons think
that the nation in general have come to like the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
style better that the old; others think that they would
gladly go back to the old way, if they could.</p>

<p>A few years ago there was a great rebellion in
China. A part of the Chinese rebelled against the
Tartars, and all the rebels put up their hair in the old
Chinese fashion; and, because they did not shave
their heads, they went by the name of the “Long-Haired
Robbers.” When any of their soldiers met
a man with a queue they knew that he was loyal to the
Tartar government, and they would kill him, or cut off
his queue, or do what they liked with him; and, on
the other hand, the life of a “Long-Haired Robber”
was not safe for a moment if he fell into the hands of
the government troops. At length, after many, many
millions of people were killed, queues carried the day,
and the rebels were conquered.</p>

<p>I have heard that thieves sometimes have their
queues cut off for a punishment, and, now and then, I
suppose, a person’s hair must fall off after illness,
but, in these cases, it would grow again.</p>

<p>There are two classes of men in China who never
wear queues—the Buddhist priests, who shave their
heads all over, and who can be known by the color of
their gowns, and their queer hats, and the Tauists,
who, as a sign of their priesthood, wear their hair in
a kind of twist on the back of their heads. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
these few exceptions, every Chinaman has a queue,
from the young child whose short hairs are pinched
up, sometimes on the crown of the head, and sometimes
on the sides of it, and braided with threads of
red silk into a tight little tail a few inches long, so
stiff that it stands straight out from the head, up to
the almost bald old man, whose straggling gray hairs
are tied into a thin wisp at the back of his neck.</p>

<p>The Chinese have usually a good quantity of hair,
coarse, perfectly straight, and jetty black, except, in
a few cases, where, from illness, the color is rusty
black. They have hardly any beard, but some of
them—though not often before they are grandfathers,
and more than forty years old—wear a much-admired
moustache. Accustomed to black locks and smooth
faces, they look curiously on the full beards of the
men, and the yellow curls of the children, of our fairer
race, or, as they style us, “The Red-Headed Foreigners.”</p>

<p>The Chinese shave the whole head, except a round
patch on the crown, about as large as a breakfast
saucer. On this they let the hair grow, and it is
combed back and down, and tied firmly with a string,
at the middle of the bottom of the patch. It is then
divided into three strands and braided. If a man is
very poor, he simply has a plat, the length of his hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
fastened at the end with a cotton string; but the Chinese
have a good deal of pride about their hair, and,
if they can afford it, like to have the queue handsomely
made. Often tresses of false hair are added
to it, for making which the hairs that fall out are carefully
saved. Of course, the hair is thinner at the end
than at the top, and to keep the braid of more even
size, and to increase its length, long bunches of black
silk cord are gradually woven into it.</p>

<p>Queues vary in length, but grown men often wear
them hanging nearly to their shoes, the upper part of
the braid being of hair, and the lower part of black
silk cord, which is tied in a tassel at the end. In
southern China, children’s queues are made bright and
jaunty with crimson silk.</p>

<p>For mourning white cord is used, and for half
mourning blue. Also, persons in mourning do not
have their heads shaven for a certain length of time.
When the emperor dies, nobody in China is expected
to be shaven for one hundred days.</p>

<p>Commonly, tidy, well-to-do people have their heads
shaven every few days, and, as no one could easily
shave the top of his own head, everybody employs a
barber. Of course there are a great many barbers,
and, with all the millions of people in China, they
have a large business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the shops, many barbers have little movable
stands containing all their tools, and they may often
be seen plying their art by the wayside, or at the
houses of their customers. The barber has a basin
of hot water, a towel, and an awkward kind of razor;
and when he has shaven and washed the head, and
braided the hair of a man, he ends up all by patting
him, with both hands, upon the back and shoulders,
in a way which, to him, is truly delightful. For all
this, his charge is not more than six cents, and a poor
man would pay still less.</p>

<p>To make his queue thicker, sometimes a Chinaman
wishes to grow more hair, and the barber will leave
his head unshaven for, perhaps, a quarter of an inch
all round the old circle of hair. When the new hair
is an inch or two long, being very stiff, it stands up in
a fringe—like a kind of black halo—all round his
head, looking very comically, and annoying the Chinaman
very much, until it is long enough to be put into
the braid.</p>

<p>When a man is at work, he finds his queue very
much in his way, and he binds it about his head, or
winds it up in a ball behind, where he sometimes fastens
it with a small wooden comb; but, in his own
country, on all occasions of form and dress, he wears
it hanging, and it would not be polite to do otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>As it would take a long time to dry it, he dislikes
to wet it, and, if rain comes on, hastens to roll it up
and cover it.</p>

<p>Sometimes beggars, to make themselves look very
wretched, do not dress their hair for a long time, and
it becomes so frizzed and matted that hardly anything
could be done to it, but to cut most of it off.</p>

<p>When a culprit is arrested in China, the officer
takes hold of his queue and leads him to prison by
it, often treating him very cruelly.</p>

<p>Little girls, as well as little boys, have their heads
shaven when they are about a month old. This is
done before an idol, with a good deal of parade.
Young girls also wear their hair in queues, but as
when older their heads are not shaven like those of
the boys, a larger quantity of hair is drawn back into
the braid, making it much heavier. When married
their hair is put up in the fashion of the women of the
district where they live, but married women never
wear their hair braided.</p>

<p>One who has lived long in China does not like to
see a thin, uneven queue, tied with a cotton string; it
has a slovenly, poverty-stricken air; while a thick,
glossy braid, with a heavy bunch of silk in the end of
it, looks tidy and prosperous; and a neat plat of silvery
hair betokens comfortable old age.</p>

<h2><a name="MEXICAN_WATER-CARRIERS" id="MEXICAN_WATER-CARRIERS">MEXICAN WATER-CARRIERS</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A MEXICAN water-carrier is always an oddly-dressed
fellow. He looks something like the
man some one met “one misty, moisty morning,”
who was all clothed in leather. He has a leather
cap, jacket and trousers, the last reaching only to his
knees, and held aside with bright buttons of silver,
so as to show the white cotton drawers beneath.
Down the front of his jacket, too, and around the rim
of his cap, are bright buttons. Fastened at his side
is a leather wallet holding his money. On his feet
are leather sandals. Over his head are two stout
leather straps, holding two jugs of earthernware, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
resting on his back and the other hanging in front.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/i-163.jpg" width="306" height="379" alt="man carrying very large urn and a pitcher" />
<div class="caption">ALWAYS ON A LITTLE INDIAN TROT.</div>
</div>

<p>He begins work early in the morning. If you go
into any of the public squares in the city of Mexico,
you will then see a great many of them all seated
around the stone basin and busy preparing for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
day’s work. They reach far over the edge and, dipping
up the water, fill their large jug. Throwing that
on their backs they reach down once more and fill
the smaller one, and then trot off and visit the different
houses of the city, and sell the families what water
they want.</p>

<p>You would say, perhaps, it was a heavy load to
carry by the head and neck, but the carrier does not
seem to mind it, for he is very strong, and the jugs
just balance each other. It is said an Englishman
was once told of this balance, and, to see if it were
so, he waited until a carrier came along and then,
with his cane, broke one of the jugs. Alas! down
came the man, jugs and all; his balance surely was
gone.</p>

<p>Water has to be brought about in this manner
because none runs into the houses by lead pipes, as
with us. It all comes from near the old castle of
Chapultepec, three or four miles from the city.</p>

<p>It runs over great stone aqueducts, built by Cortes,
and when it reaches the public square falls into the
stone basins of the city. So, you see, it makes these
carriers almost like our milkmen, only they do not
come with a fine horse and carriage, and do not
make nearly as much money. They only get a few
cents each day. How hard they work, too! Busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
from morn till eve, always earnest, hardly ever smiling,
always on a little Indian trot, they go about from
house to house, and then, when the day’s work is
over, what a life they lead!</p>

<p>They have no home to go to, either; they live in
the streets, sleep in the gutter or on the cathedral
stone steps, and often, I fear, get so befogged on
“pulque,” the national drink, that they care not
whether they have a home and good bed or not.</p>

<p>Think what a miserable existence, not knowing
how to read, dressing as those before them did three
hundred years ago, and doing nothing but carrying
water about the city. Every day they will go into the
great cathedral and say their prayers. They put their
jugs down beside them, clasp their hands, raise their
eyes to the image of their patron saint, and mumble
their requests or their thanks, and then, taking a last
look at the gold candlesticks and rich ornaments, will
hurry away, and continue their hard, uninteresting
daily labors.</p>

<h2><a name="A_VERY_QUEER_HOUSE" id="A_VERY_QUEER_HOUSE">A VERY QUEER HOUSE.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE are few pleasanter places in summer
than the great square of Et-Meidaun at Constantinople.
The tall gray pointed monument in the
middle, like a sentry watching over the whole place,
the white houses along either side, the polished pavement,
the high white walls and rounded domes, and
tall slender towers and cool shadowy gateways of
the Turkish mosques together with the bright blue
sky overhead and the bright blue sea in the distance
below, make a very pretty picture indeed.</p>

<p>The different people, too, that go past us are quite
a show in themselves. Now, it is a Turkish soldier
in blue frock and red cap—a fine tall fellow, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
rather thin and pale, as if he did not always get
enough to eat; now, a tall, dark, grave-looking American,
with a high funnel-shaped hat, and a long black
frock right down to his feet. There comes a big,
jolly-looking English sailor, rolling himself along
with his hands in his pockets and his hat on one
side. There goes a Russian with a broad flat face
and thick yellow beard. That tall handsome man in
the laced jacket and black velvet trousers, who is
looking after him so fiercely, is a Circassian, who
was fighting against the Russians among the mountains
of the Caucasus not many years ago. And
behind him is an Arab water-carrier, with limbs bare
to the knee and a huge skin bag full of water on his
back.</p>

<p>But the strangest sight of all is still to come.</p>

<p>Halting to look around I suddenly espy a pair of
yellow Turkish slippers, a good deal worn, lying at
the foot of a huge tree which stands alone in the
midst of the open space. They are not flung carelessly
down, either, as if their owner had thrown
them away, but placed neatly side by side; just as an
orderly old gentleman might put <i>his</i> slippers beside
the fire before going out. And, stranger still,
although at least half a dozen bare-footed Turks
(who might think even an old shoe worth picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
up) have passed by and seen them, not one of them
has ventured to disturb them in any way.</p>

<p>My Greek companion notices my surprise, and
gives a knowing grin, like a man who has just asked
you a riddle which he is sure you will never guess.</p>

<p>“Aha, Effendi! Don’t you think he must have
been a careless fellow who left his slippers there?
See anything odd about this tree?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but that piece of board on it which I
suppose covers a hollow.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” chuckles the Greek. “It covers
a <i>hollow</i>, sure enough—look here, Effendi!”</p>

<p>He taps thrice upon the “piece of board,” which
suddenly swings back like a door, disclosing to my
astonished eyes, in the dark hollow, the long blue
robe, white turban, and flowing beard of an old Turk.</p>

<p>“Peace be with you!” says the old gentleman in
a deep hoarse voice, nodding to my companion,
whom he seems to know.</p>

<p>“With you be peace,” answers the Greek. “You
didn’t expect that, did you, Effendi? It’s not every
day that you find a man living inside a tree?”</p>

<p>“<i>Does</i> he live here, then?”</p>

<p>“To be sure he does. Didn’t you see his slippers
at the door? Nobody would touch the slippers for
any money. They all know old Selim. He has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
snug house, after all; and don’t pay <i>rent</i> either!”</p>

<p>In truth, the little place is snug enough, and certainly
holds a good deal for its size. On one side is
an earthen water-jar, on the other a huge blanket-like
cloak, which probably represents Mr. Selim’s
whole stock of bedding. A copper stew-pan is fixed
to a spike driven into the wood, while just above it
a small iron funnel, neatly fitted into a knot-hole of
the trunk, does duty as a chimney. Around the
sides of the hollow hang a long pipe, a tobacco-pouch,
a leathern wallet, and some other articles, all
bearing marks of long service; while to crown all,
my guide shows me, triumphantly, just outside the
door, a wooden shelf with several pots of flowers—a
garden that just matches the house.</p>

<p>Having given us this sight of his house-keeping,
the old gentleman (who has been standing like a
statue during the whole inspection) silently holds
out his hand. I drop into it a double piastre (ten
cents) and take my leave, reflecting that if it is good
to be content with little this old hermit is certainly a
bit of a hero in his way.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_BELGIUM" id="IN_BELGIUM">IN BELGIUM.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AFTER rolling and tossing for twenty-four hours
upon the German Ocean, the sight of land
should be hailed with a spirit of thankfulness. But
of all inhospitable shores, those of the Belgian coast,
in the month of November, must carry the palm.
The waters, gray and rough, dash upon a sandy beach
for miles and miles, showing no signs of life, if we
except an occasional wind-mill in action. Row after
row of poplar trees form a partial back-ground.
Somewhat stripped of their leaves, they have the
appearance of so many gray pillars holding up
the sky.</p>

<p>As the low-built towns with their red houses rise to
view, and the dikes present themselves, if this be the
first introduction into Continental Europe, the foreignness
stands out in bold relief. But as you ascend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
river the villages are more interesting and indications
of life more frequent. Long before reaching the pier
at Antwerp, its towers salute the travellers, and the
gratitude becomes apparent on each and every visage.</p>

<p>Our little windows in the above-mentioned city
overlooked its prettiest park, in the centre of which
stands the statue of Rubens. At the right, yet full
in view, stands the Cathedral of Notre Dame, famous
for its ninety-nine bells (why not one more?) and the
masterpieces of the great artist of Antwerp.</p>

<p>Of these paintings, the “Assumption,” which has
within a comparatively short time been restored, is
truly beautiful, the countenances of the several figures
wearing a pure expression, which is not a characteristic
of the Rubens face in general. The fame of
the others is perhaps yet greater than that of the
“Assumption,” and everywhere in our own country
are engravings and photographs of the same, on
exhibition or in private collections. Before these
the lover of art lingers to study, and studying continues
to linger. For me, alas! these <i>chef d’œuvres</i>,
“The Ascent to the Cross” and the “The Descent
from the Cross,” have no attractions.</p>

<p>The music of the bells at sunset repays one, not
only for the tumble of the German Sea, but for the
voyage across the Atlantic, especially in the autumn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
when the twilights are so short that the Mall is lightest
as the sun goes down. This music singularly
contrasts with the noise made by the footfall of the
peasants. This numerous class, hurrying home at
dusk, take the park as their shorter course. The
click-clack of the hundreds of wooden shoes of all
sizes and intensities, rapidly “getting by,” is something
that can never be imagined. As these articles
of apparel are seldom of a snug fit in the region of
the heel, there is a peculiar introduction to each
grand step. The quantity and quality of this noise
are astonishing; the novelty, a charm.</p>

<p>There is one sound, however, which is sensibly
wanting among the lower class of Belgians. It may
never have been in the experience of others, but it
could not be entirely my own imagination—I missed
the human voice in the groups of peasantry. The
uneducated of other countries have at least a common
“mongrel tongue” to some extent, but the individual
vocabulary of this class is certainly very limited,
which is a check to prolonged conversation. This
feature was to me a cause satisfactory for the stillness
of the streets, thronged as they sometimes are, and
may be the reason that the foot-fall is so impressive,
with its wooden encumbrances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to the shoe, the attraction was the harnessed
dogs and the young girls drawing burdens.</p>

<p>When a woman was seen wheeling a cart or trundling
a barrow, it was just to conclude that she was in
the interest of her own gain, and we could pass on.
When the dogs, the old and despised of their kind,
were leisurely carrying their wagon of vegetables,
provided the driver was kind, it was rather a foreign
sight than a painful one. Often these dogs lie down
in the harness—the latter not being very elaborate—and
do not seem unwilling to rise to the occasion.
When it happened, as often it did, during our short
sojourn in Belgium, that we saw girls, the young and
bright and strong, bearing these burdens, frequently
sharing the harness with the aforesaid animals, the
American heart rebelled. If they were rough, hoydenish
girls, romping all day long, filling their carts with
sand for the fun and having a boy-companion as a
play-driver, we should even then think, do they <i>never</i>
go to school?</p>

<p>But they were not of this class! They were the
quiet and obedient, generally tidy in appearance,
calmly accepting their lot in life through ignorance.
I never saw a boy thus disgraced; not that I feel less
glad for “him,” but the more sad for “her.”</p>

<p>When walking one day, having lost my way, I met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
one of these teams. There were connected with it two
young girls, about fifteen years of age—one harnessed
and drawing the load, the other having the
charge of the cargo, which, from its too great abundance,
required constant diligence. I inquired of
them the direction to the hotel.</p>

<p>Without altering a muscle, they continued their
gaze (we had begun the stare from afar). So listless
was it that they seemed like pet animals, who look
at one confidingly, except in the case of the latter
there will be “wink of recognition.” No attempt
was made to reply. After I turned, they kept their
eyes upon the space which I had occupied, as if I
had merely been an obstruction to their sunshine. A
person, not far from them, answered my inquiries,
adding, with a nod towards the “little workers,”
“they only talk mongrel.”</p>

<p>This woman, short and chubby, forcibly reminded
me of somebody or something in the past. After a
brief reflection, behold the solution:</p>

<p>Before toys had become so elaborate in our own
country, there occasionally found their way from
Holland images of pewter, representing the dairy-maids
of that part of Europe. They were far different
from the pewter-pieces of the present day, being
thicker and less destructible. The one that came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
into my possession, the delight of my heart, wore the
short, full dress and sun-bonnet, with arms akimbo.
The one, ah me! that would have been my choice
was purchased by a class-mate, she having at that
time, and I presume at this time, twice my amount of
funds. The price of this precious bit was two cents.</p>

<p>The latter figure, unlike mine, had the pail poised
upon the head. It was probably a true likeness of
the renowned maid that counted the chickens in
advance, thereby showing the people of her country
to have been “born calculators.” I think the
little body that showed me the way to my lodgings
descended in a direct line from this old mathematical
stock, and was a little proud of her origin. Her
language was a mixture of Dutch, French, and, for all
I know, several dead languages, <i>but</i>—and I have her
own authority for it—not a mongrel tongue. Out of
gratitude to one who led me to my home, I should
speak well of this woman, as of the proverbial bridge,
so am quite willing to accept her statement and
allow her a “pure dialect.”</p>

<h2><a name="JOE_THE_CHIMPANZEE" id="JOE_THE_CHIMPANZEE">JOE THE CHIMPANZEE.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN in England I was very much interested
in the monkeys at the Zoological Gardens,
Regent’s Park, London. There were hundreds of
all kinds and sizes, from the gigantic orang-outang
to tiny creatures not much bigger than a large rat.</p>

<p>These monkeys had a spacious glass house, heated
by steam; and as a tropical temperature was always
maintained, tall palms and luxurious vines grew
so vigorously within its walls that I have no doubt
the quaint inmates supposed themselves in their
native haunts.</p>

<p>They chattered and scolded each other, wildly
chased stray little dogs and kittens, and really
seemed to know so much that I half believed an old
keeper, who told me the only reason they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
talk, was because they could make themselves well
enough understood without.</p>

<p>Many funny stories I heard of their sagacity. One
I recall of a nurse who shook a naughty little boy in
the presence of some of the mother monkeys, whereupon
all the old monkeys began shaking all the
young ones until it seemed as if their poor little
heads would drop off.</p>

<p>But, interested in all the singular inhabitants of the
house, I grew attached to Joe, the young chimpanzee
who had been brought a baby from the coast of Guinea
the winter before. He had a little room on the sunny
side of the monkey house, with a stove, table,
chairs and a couple of beds arranged like the berths
in the state room of an ocean steamer. Besides he
had a man all to himself, to wait upon him; and it
was no wonder the other monkeys were jealous of
his superior quarters and the deference paid him; for
while Joe was not handsome he was worth more
money than all the others put together.</p>

<p>He was worth this great sum because he belonged
to the most intelligent and interesting species of the
monkey family, and only one or two of his kinsfolk
had ever been seen in Europe, while the only one the
Zoological Society had ever owned, had died of lung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
fever before he had inhabited his comfortable quarters
many months.</p>

<p>Joe was about as tall as an average boy of eight
or ten years. He wore a thick cloth roundabout,
and a low flat trencher cap such as the Oxford students
delight in.</p>

<p>One day I walked to the door of his room and
knocked. The keeper said “Come in,” and as I did
so Joe walked erect over the floor to me, pulled off
his cap with his left hand, and put out his right to
shake mine. When I said “It is a fine morning,”
he bowed briskly; but when I added, “Are you pretty
well, Joe?” he shook his head and looked very
sober. The keeper explained: “Joe had a cold, and
that made him very low spirited.”</p>

<p>Joe was listening attentively; and when the man
finished, he shivered and drew up the collar of
his jacket round his hairy throat, as if to confirm the
statement.</p>

<p>I gave him an apple, which he looked at a moment,
then opened the door of the oven of his stove,
and put it in out of sight. Seeming to understand
that the fire was low, he pulled a basket from under
the lower berth and took some bits of wood from it
to the stove. Then the keeper handed him a match,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and he lighted a fire as cleverly as any Yankee boy
I ever saw.</p>

<p>“Show the lady how you read <i>The Times</i>, Joe,”
said the keeper.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/i-179.jpg" width="293" height="303" alt="chimpanzee in suit sitting in chair with newspaper" />
<div class="caption">JOE READS “<i>The Times</i>.”</div>
</div>

<p>Joe drew up a chair, tilted it back a little, spread
his legs apart, opened the sheet, turned it until he
found the page he wanted, then settled himself into
the exact position of the comfortable English gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
who supposes <i>The Times</i> is printed for his exclusive
use. It was impossible to help laughing, and
the sly twinkle in his narrow eye assured us Joe himself
knew how funny it was.</p>

<p>Quite a crowd had gathered at the open door of
his room, and as he noticed it, he put his hand in his
pocket drew out the one eye-glass Englishman so
particularly affect, and put it to his eye looking as
weakly wise as Lord Dundreary himself. After a
little he grew tired of so many spectators, left his
chair and quietly shut the door in their faces.</p>

<p>Looking about as if he would do something more
for our amusement, he remembered his apple in the
stove oven. Running there he took hold of the door,
but suddenly drew back, for it was hot. He laughed
a little at his discomfiture which he took in good
part, stood thinking a moment, then used his pocket-handkerchief
as deftly as a dainty lady would to accomplish
his purpose. But if the door was hot,
the apple, Joe logically reasoned, must be hotter; so
he ventured not to touch it before opening his knife.
Wondering what he was going to do, I found him
sticking the blade into the apple and bringing it out
in triumph. The keeper gave him a plate, and after
letting the apple cool a little he offered it to us. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
courteously declined, but the servant tasted, explaining
that Joe did not like to eat anything alone.
Then Joe followed, but did not like the flavor, and
being asked if it was sour, he nodded. We were
told that he, in common with the other monkeys,
liked oranges and bananas better than any other
fruits.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/i-181.jpg" width="306" height="315" alt="chimpanzee in bathrobe getting apple out of oven" />
<div class="caption">JOE TRIES HIS APPLE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet he kept tasting a little of the apple from a
spoon while the keeper told us how the sailors who
hoped to capture his mother only succeeded in bringing
him off alive after they had killed her. They
had hard work to keep him alive on board ship, but
found a warm nook for him by the galley fire. He
was in fair health when they landed, so they obtained
the large price offered by the Zoological Gardens;
but in spite of the most devoted care, he seemed to
languish in his new home.</p>

<p>“Do you love me, Joe?” the man ended his story
with. Joe nodded, smiled, and put his head lovingly
on the other’s shoulder.</p>

<p>As we left that day, Joe took his hat, cane, and
heavy wrap, and escorted us to the great door of the
monkey house, shaking our hands as we bade him
good-bye.</p>

<p>Another time when I called he was taking tea, using
milk and sugar and handling cup and saucer as
if he had been familiar with them from his earliest
days. He motioned us to take chairs. We did so
and he jumped up, found cups for us, and then
passed a plate of biscuits, laughing with glee as we
took one. I have taken tea with many curious individuals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
but never expect to be so honored again as
to be invited by a chimpanzee.</p>

<p>Noticing his hand was feverish, I found his pulse
was 130. I said “What is the matter of him?”</p>

<p>“Consumption is what kills all of them,” the man
answered, low, just as if talking before a human
invalid.</p>

<p>From that day Joe failed rapidly, and one morning
under the head of “Great Loss,” <i>The Times</i> announced
that he died at midnight.</p>

<p>I went down at once to see the keeper whose grief
I knew would be keen.</p>

<p>He told me how for days, Joe could only be persuaded
to take food by seeing him eat and hearing
him praise it, how he made him sleep in his berth by
his side, and when death came, held his hand through
all the last struggle.</p>

<p>The man’s voice was actually choked with sobs as
he said, “It don’t seem right, indeed it don’t, not to
have a funeral for him! He ought to have had it.”</p>

<p>I never heard Joe had any funeral, but I did hear
that he was stuffed, and looks more like a big boy
than when he was alive.</p>

<h2><a name="MARKET_DAY_AT_PAU" id="MARKET_DAY_AT_PAU">MARKET DAY AT PAU.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IF you don’t know where Pau is, do as I did when
I first heard of it,—look it up on some large map
of France.</p>

<p>Down in the southeast corner, at the mouth of the
Adour river, you will see the city from which the bayonet
is said to have received its name; and if you
move your finger along about an inch due east from
Bayonne you will be likely to pass it directly under
Pau.</p>

<p>It is the capital of one of the finest departments of
France, the Basses-Pyrénées; and its mild, equable
climate and charming scenery have made it, for the
last thirty years, a favorite winter resort for invalids
and pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>As the capital of the old province of Béarn, and as
the seat of the ancient royal castle where flourished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the Gastons and Marguerites, and where Henri IV. of
France was born, Pau has many interesting historical
associations, upon which, however, we must resolutely
turn our backs if we mean to go to market this morning.</p>

<p>Monday is always market-day at Pau, and then it
is that the country comes bodily in and takes possession
of the town. At five o’clock in the morning the
rumbling of cart-wheels and the clatter of sabots
down in the cold gray streets announce the approach
of a rustic army from the villages round about. On
they come from every quarter all through the forenoon,
and if we walk out anywhere—say to the
Alléés de Morlaäs, where we can sit on one of the
benches under the trees and gaze now and then at
the distant snowy Pyrenees,—we shall see the endless
stream of market-people.</p>

<p>The men wear round woolen caps without visors,
called the <i>béret;</i> a short frock, usually of some coarse
cotton material, which is gathered so much about the
neck as not to improve their stumpy figures; and
huge wooden shoes that rattle and thump along the
pavements, bringing with them on rainy days an incredible
quantity of country mud.</p>

<p>The most noticeable feature in the dress of the
women is the bright foulard handkerchief that serves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
instead of hat or bonnet. It is arranged according to
the taste and age of the wearer, and is capable of
producing a wide range of effects.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">A peasant woman.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The guide-book assures us that the <i>paysannes</i> walk
barefoot on the country roads; but, upon approaching
the town, they cover their wayworn feet with the
cherished shoes and stockings that have thus been
spared from wear and tear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>On a cold spring morning we saw a company of
women descending a hill at Lourdes with enormous
bundles of wood on their heads. As we were pitying
the bare feet that went toiling down the steep way,
we suddenly spied their shoes dangling from the fagots
where they had considerately placed them, to be
out of harm.</p>

<p>The strength of these little peasant women is wonderful.
They walk off with grand strides, carrying
heavy burdens on their heads, and sometimes knitting
as they go. Many of the young girls are very pretty;
but exposure and hard work soon change the fresh
tint and the graceful outlines to a brown wrinkled
visage and a gaunt ungainly figure.</p>

<p>Sitting here, we are attracted by a jaunty young
creature tripping along with a large, round, shallow
basket of salad, or <i>choux de Bruxelles</i>, on her head,
carelessly steadying it with one hand, while in the
other she carries a pair of chickens or a basket of
eggs. But how can we see a pinched-looking woman
tugging along under a big bag of potatoes, or breaking
stones on the road, without feeling tired ourselves
and sad? And neither the sadness nor the weariness
is lightened upon seeing, as we invariably do, that
when a woman is working with a man he generously
gives her the heaviest end of the load.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 307px;">
<img src="images/i-188.jpg" width="307" height="166" alt="man leading cart pulled by axen" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ox-team.</span></div>
</div>

<p>The wood is brought in on clumsy carts, generally
two-wheeled and often covered. The oxen and cows
that draw these carts have their bodies draped with
coarse linen covers, and across their heads is a strip
of sheep-skin, which is worn with the shaggy side out
and the skinny side in. M. Taine tells us in his
book on the Pyrenees that he saw the heads of the
cattle protected by thread nets and ferns, which, I
trust is their usual summer coiffure; for in a country
where, in winter, gentlemen carry parasols and wear
large white streamers depending from their hats, to
protect the head and back of the neck from the too
ardent rays of the sun, even the “patient ox” might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
complain of the unfitness of a head-dress of sheep
skin.</p>

<p>The driver of the ox-team is armed with a long
stick, at the end of which is an iron goad. This he
uses either in guiding the cattle, which is done by going
in advance of them and stretching the stick backward
with a queer, stiff gesture, or in pricking and
prodding the poor creatures till they hardly know
which way to turn. The cattle, which are mostly of a
light brown color, are very large and fine; but it
seems strange to us to see cows wearing the yoke.</p>

<p>But, O! the donkey! The wise, the tough, the
musical, the irresistible, the universal donkey! How
shall I ever give you an idea of what he becomes to
an appreciative mind that has daily opportunities of
studying his “tricks and manners!”</p>

<p>Fancy one of these long-eared, solemn-eyed gentry,
scarcely larger than a good-sized Newfoundland dog
jogging along with a double pannier bulging at his
sides and a fat market-woman on his back.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">

<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">One of these long-eared, solemn-eyed gentry.</span>”</div>
</div>

<p>But the disproportion between the size of the beast
and that of his burden, and his gravity and circumspection,
is scarcely funnier here than when he is
placed before a two-wheeled cart, a story and a half
higher than himself, and containing a man, a woman,
a boy, and a pig; sometimes cabbages and chickens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
often two or three inexperienced calves. And in the
afternoon, when market is over, I have often seen six
or seven women huddled into one of these primitive
chariots, each provided with the inevitable stocking
her tongue and her knitting-needles keeping time as
the cart goes tilting along over the famous roads of
the Basses-Pyrénées. The gay handkerchiefs of the
women, the purple, blue and gray stockings with
their flashing needles, and the huge brown loaves of
bread sure to be protruding in various quarters, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
these groups, returning from market, most picturesquely
striking.</p>

<p>Coming in from the <i>Alléés de Morlaäs</i> we find, as
we approach the <i>Place des Eçoles</i>, an animated scene.
The broad sidewalk is lined with rows of women selling
vegetables, fruit, flowers, poultry and eggs. The
haggling of the buyers and the gibing of the venders,
though carried on in <i>patois</i> unintelligible to us, are
expressed in tones and accompanied by gestures that
translate them quite effectively; especially as not a
market-day passes without a long recital from our
Catherine, illustrating the greed of the peasants and
her own superior finesse.</p>

<p>“How much do you want for this chicken?”</p>

<p>“Three francs.”</p>

<p>“Keep your chicken for somebody see. I’ll go to
another.”</p>

<p>“Stay! What will you give for it?”</p>

<p>“Two francs.”</p>

<p>“Get along with you!”</p>

<p>As Catherine eyes the chicken which she secretly
admires and openly abuses, another cook comes up
and lays her hand on its comely breast. It is a decisive
moment, but Catherine is equal to the emergency.</p>

<p>“Stand off there! I’m here first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with a secret resolve that her <i>demoiselles</i> shall
dine on that little plump <i>poulet</i>, she offers fifty sous
and carries off the prize. To see her enter our <i>salon</i>
bearing a waiter on which are a dozen fine rosy apples
and two large russet pears, with the question,
“Guess how much I paid for all?” written in every
line of her shrewd old face, is something worth coming
to Europe for. To make a sharp bargain, to
cook a good dinner, and never to waste anything,
these are the aims of her life and the themes of her
discourse.</p>

<p>Our snug <i>appartement</i> is opposite the <i>Place des
Eçoles</i>, where the wood and cattle are sold; and the
first peep in the morning gives us a picture, lively
enough and foreign enough to make us look and look
again many times during the day till late in the afternoon
when the <i>Place</i> is nearly bare; and the aspect
of the few patient but rather dejected-looking peasants
whose wood has not yet found purchasers almost
tempts us to run over and buy a load or two,
just for the pleasure of sending the poor creatures
home with lighter hearts and heavier pockets. What
would Catherine say to that, I wonder?</p>

<p>Besides the interest which we feel in the various
natural hangers-on of the wood-carts (and each one
has from two to five of both sexes and all sizes), we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
get no small amusement from their patrons, who represent
all sorts of townspeople, from the fat old
woman of the green grocery and sausage-shop over
the way, who peddles with easy affability among the
market-people, to the lordly young Englishman who
dashes on to the <i>Place</i> with the air of a conquering
hero, and loftily indicates with his riding-whip the
load that has the honor to meet his approval.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 204px;">

<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">The favorite way of transporting a pig.</span>”</div>
</div>

<p>Troops of frisky calves are scattered about, and
groups of blue blouses and red <i>bérets</i> are earnestly
discussing the merits of the unsuspecting innocents.
More rarely a fine cow, or a yoke of oxen, attracts a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
circle of connoisseurs; then the <i>patois</i> becomes more
fluent, and the gestures more animated, and the fists
of the interested parties are seen flourishing unpleasantly
near the disdainful noses of the critics.</p>

<p>The prolonged and penetrating squeal of that pig
in the <i>Rue des Cultivateurs</i> reminds me that this interesting
animal figures largely in the scenes of market-day.
Pork being an important article of peasant
diet, Mr. Piggy is always abroad on Monday and contributes
largely to the general éclat.</p>

<p>The favorite way of transporting a moderate sized
pig is to put him about the neck, holding his hind
feet with one hand and his forefeet with the other.
This method, though attended with some disadvantages,
such as the proximity of the squeal to the ear
of the carrier, is, on the whole, less worrying than
that of tying a string to one of the hind legs of his
Porkship, this giving him a chance to pull his way
with more or less effect, while the peasant is frantically
jerking in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Not infrequently a pig gets a ride home from market
in the cart of his new owner. Then, true to his
nature and principles, he resists the honor accorded
him with the whole might of his legs and lungs; so
that, with a man at his hind legs, a woman at his
left ear, and a boy at his right fore leg, he is with difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
assisted to his coach and is held there, <i>en route</i>,
by that “eternal vigilance” which is, in more senses
than one, “the price of liberty.”</p>

<p>On the <i>Rue Porte Neuve</i> and near the <i>Halle Neuve</i>,
in the centre of the town, the venders of agricultural
implements, kitchen hardware, locks and keys, secondhand
books, handkerchiefs, collars, cuffs, hats, bracelets,
rings, baskets, brooms, bottles, mouse-traps, and
other miscellaneous articles, display their goods, and
a sudden shower makes bad work in this busy community.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>By the <i>Halle Neuve</i> is the fruit and vegetable market
also, and farther on, in the <i>Rue de la Préfecture</i>,
we suddenly come upon a hollow square inclosed on
three sides by ancient looking buildings, one of which
is the <i>Nieille Halle;</i> and here are fish, poultry and
game, and the queerest-looking market-people in the
whole town, it seems to me.</p>

<p>There is a flower market on the <i>Place Royal</i>, and
you will see the Spanish women there, with their
foulards and trinkets, to catch a few sous from the
rustics.</p>

<p>We cannot confine our interest to the market-folk,
however, for everybody is more or less picturesque in
this strange land, and we are never tired of saying,
“See here,” and “See there.” Sometimes it is a gray-haired
spinner with her ancient distaff that attracts
our notice, as she sits in a sunny door-way or totters
along the sidewalk; and then there are the antics of
these foreign children! Béarnais boys are as fond of
standing on their heads as their American brethren
are, but their large and heavy <i>sabots</i> are a great in
convenience.</p>

<p>Just look at those wooden shoes ranged along the
sidewalk over there, while the owners thereof are
flourishing their emancipated heels in fine style.</p>

<p>These are some of the sights of a market-day at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Pau; but how can you ever get a notion of the
sounds? For when we add to the market-day hubbub
the various every-day street cries that mingle
with it we have a strange orchestra.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 232px;">
<img src="images/i-197.jpg" width="232" height="325" alt="boys standing on heads" />
<div class="caption">“<span class="smcap">As fond of standing on their heads as their American brethren.</span>”</div>
</div>

<p>There are the charcoal men, who begin on a high
key and drop with an almost impossible interval to a
prolonged, nasal, twanging note; the old clo’ men,
whose <i>patois</i> for rags sounds so exactly like my companion’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
name that she is sure they are after the
dresses she is economically wearing out at Pau; the
chimney-sweeps; the <i>jonchée</i> women, who sell cream
cheese, rolled in what looks like onion-tops; the
roasted chestnut women, whose shrill “Tookow!”
(<i>patois</i> for “<i>Tout chaud</i>”) suggests piping-hot chestnuts
in bursting shells; and the crockery and earthen
men, who push their wares before them in long shallow
box-carts, and give, in a sustained recitative, the
whole catalogue of delf and pottery.</p>

<p>In the afternoon when the noise and stir are subsiding,
we hear a few notes, often repeated, from
what I should like to call a shepherd’s pipe; only the
instrument in question is not in the least like one,
but resembles more one of those little musical toys
with a row of holes cut along one side, upon which
our children at home are so fond of performing.
However, our shepherd contrives to produce a pastoral
effect with his simple strain, and we favor the illusion
of the pipe by only listening to him, while we
look at his pretty goats with long, silky black hair.
He leads them through the town twice a day, and at
the sound of his call those who wish goat’s milk send
out their glasses and get it warm from a goat milked
at the door. As his last faint notes die out in the
distance the rosy light fades from the peaks of the
Pyrenees; the sun has set, and market-day is over.</p>

<h2><a name="IL_SANTISSIMO_BAMBINO" id="IL_SANTISSIMO_BAMBINO">IL SANTISSIMO BAMBINO.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">ON the Capitoline Hill, in Rome, stands a church,
twelve hundred years old, called Ara Cœli. It
is unpromising in its outward appearance, but is rich
in marbles and mosaics within.</p>

<p>The most precious possession of this ancient church
however, is a wooden doll called Il Santissimo Bambino—The
Most Holy Infant. It is dressed like an
Italian baby, and an Italian baby is dressed like a
mummy. We often see them in their mothers’ arms,
so swathed that they can no more move than a bundle
without any baby inside of it. Their little legs must
ache for the freedom of kicking. The dress of <i>the</i>
Bambino is very different from that of <i>a</i> bambino after
all, for it is cloth of silver, and it sparkles all over
with jewels which have been presented to it, and it
wears a golden crown upon its head.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i-200.jpg" width="300" height="525" alt="Icon" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Bambino.</span> Page 205.</div>
</div>

<p>This is the history of this remarkable doll, as devout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Roman Catholics believe. You must judge for yourselves
how much of it is truth and how much fable.</p>

<p>They say this image of the infant Saviour was
carved from olive-wood which grew upon the Mount
of Olives, by a monk who lived in Palestine; and, as
he had no means of painting it with sufficient beauty,
his prayers prevailed upon St. Luke to come down
from Heaven and color it for him. Then he sent it to
Rome to be present at the Christmas festival. It was
shipwrecked on the way, but finally came safely to
land, and was received with great reverence by the
Franciscan monks, who placed it in a shrine at Ara
Cœli. It was soon found to have miraculous power
to heal the sick, and was so often sent for to visit
them, that, at one time, it received more fees than any
physician in Rome. It has its own carriage in which
it rides abroad, and its own attendants who guard it
with the utmost care.</p>

<p>One woman was so selfish as to think it would be
a capital thing if she could get possession of this wonder-working
image for herself and her friends.</p>

<p>“She had another doll prepared of the same size
and appearance as the ‘Santissimo,’ and having
feigned sickness and obtained permission to have it
left with her, she dressed the false image in its
clothes, and sent it back to Ara Cœli. The fraud was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
not discovered till night, when the Franciscan monks
were awakened by the most furious ringing of bells
and by thundering knocks at the west door of the
church, and, hastening thither, could see nothing but
a wee, naked, pink foot peeping in from under the
door; but when they opened the door, without
stood the little naked figure of the true Bambino
of Ara Cœli, shivering in the wind and rain. So the
false baby was sent back in disgrace, and the real
baby restored to its home, never to be trusted away
alone any more.”</p>

<p>This marvelous escape is duly recorded in the
Sacristy of the church where the Bambino safely
dwells under lock and key all the year, except the
time from Christmas to Epiphany, when it comes
out to receive the homage of the people.</p>

<p>We went to see it last Christmas.</p>

<p>As I told you, the church stands on one of the Seven
Hills of the Eternal City; it is approached by a flight
of stone steps as wide as the building itself and as
high as the hill. There were many beggars on
these steps; some old and blind, others young and
bright-eyed. Beside the beggars, there were people
with tiny images of the Baby in the Manger, toy
sheep, and pictures of the Bambino for sale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">
<img src="images/i-204.jpg" width="472" height="310" alt="carriage" />
<div class="caption">THE EQUIPAGE OF THE BAMBINO.</div>
</div>

<p>When we went into the church, we found one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
chapels fitted up like a tableau. The chapels are something
like large alcoves along the sides of a church.
Each is consecrated to some saint, and often belongs
to some particular family who have their weddings
and funerals there.</p>

<p>It was in the second chapel on the left that we
found the scene represented. The Virgin Mary was
dressed in a bright blue silk, adorned with various
jewels. In her lap lay the Bambino, about the size of
a baby six weeks old. I do not believe St. Luke
painted its face, for it was not half so well done
as most of the wooden dolls we see. An artificial
mule had his nose close to the baby’s head.
Joseph sat near, and in front the shepherds were
kneeling. All these people were of life-size, made of
wood, and dressed in real clothes. Beyond them was
to be seen a pretty landscape—sheep, covered with
real wool, a girl with a pitcher on her head coming down
a path to a sparkling fountain of <i>glass</i>. In the distance
was the town of Bethlehem. In mid-air hovered
an angel, hung by a wire in his back from the
ceiling. On pasteboard screens, above the Virgin and
Child were painted a crowd of cherubs looking down,
and in their midst God the Father—whom no one
hath seen nor can see—was represented in the likeness
of a venerable man, spreading his hands in
blessing over the group below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>A great many little children were coming with the
older people to look at all this, and talking, in their
pretty Italian tongue, about the “Bambino.”</p>

<p>Epiphany, as perhaps you know, is the day kept in
memory of the visit of the Wise Men where the Star
in the East guided to our Saviour’s cradle. On that
day, Il Santissimo Bambino was to be carried with all
ceremony back to the Sacristy; so we went to see
that.</p>

<p>We were glad to find the Blessed Virgin had two
nice silk dresses; she had changed from blue to red,
and the Bambino was standing on her knee. The
Shepherds had gone, and the Wise Men had come,
all very gorgeous in flowered brocade and cloth of
gold, with crowns on their heads, and pages to hold
their trains.</p>

<p>It was yet an hour or two before the “Procession of
the Bambino” would proceed; so we went out of
the side door of the church to stray about the Capitoline
Hill in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>We went down the steps where Tiberius Gracchus,
the friend of the people, was killed, some two thousand
years ago. That brought us into a small square
called Piazza di Campidoglio. It is surrounded on
three sides by public buildings, and in front has a
grand stairway leading down to the street. It was in
this very spot that Brutus made his famous speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
after the assassination of Julius Cæsar. We crossed
the square, went up some steps and through an archway.</p>

<p>A company of little Romans were playing soldier
there, and the small drum-major made the walls of
the capitol resound with his rattling music. That
reminds me to tell you that Santa Claus does not
visit Italy; but an old woman, named Navona, comes
instead. She may be his wife, for aught I know; in
fact, it seems quite likely, for she has a way, just like
his, of coming down the chimney, bringing gifts for
the good children and switches for the naughty.
These must have been very good little boys, for
every one of them seemed to have a new sword or
gun. Probably Navona has to keep the house while
Santa Claus is away about his Christmas business,
and that is the reason she does not reach her small
people here until the night before Epiphany, the 6th
of January.</p>

<p>We went down a lane of poor houses, dodging the
clothes which hung drying over our heads, and came
to a large green gate in the high stone wall of a garden.
We knocked, but no one answered. Presently
a black-eyed little boy came running to us, glad to
earn two or three sous by going to call the <i>custode</i>.
While we wait for him to do so, I must tell you why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
we wished to go through this green door. You have
read, either in Latin or English, the story of Tarpæia,
the Roman maiden, who consented to show the Latin
soldiers the way into the citadel if they would give
her what they wore on their left arms, meaning their
bracelets, and then the grim joke they played after
she had done her part, by throwing upon her their
shields, which were also “what they wore on their
left arms.”</p>

<p>It was to see the Tarpæian rock, where she led her
country’s enemies up, and where, later, traitors were
hurled down, that we wished to go through the gate.
Presently the keeper came, a rosy young woman, leading
a little girl, who was feeling very rich over a new
dolly she was dangling by its arm.</p>

<p>We were admitted to a small garden, where pretty
pink roses were in blossom, and the oranges were
hanging on the trees, though the icicles were fringing
the fountain not far away. On the edge of the garden,
along the brow of the cliff, runs a thick wall of
brown stone; we leaned over it and looked down the
steep rock which one assaulting party after another
tried, in old times, to scale.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/i-210.jpg" width="360" height="559" alt="woman seated holding baby with daughter looking at baby and son standing behind" />
<div class="caption">FAMILY OF ROMAN BEGGARS.</div>
</div>

<p>It was on this side that the Gauls were trying to
reach the citadel at the time the geese saved the city.
Do you know that for a long time, annually, a dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was crucified on the capitol, and a goose carried in
triumph, because, on that occasion, the dogs failed to
give the alarm and the geese did it!</p>

<p>We looked down on the roofs and into the courts
of poor houses which have huddled close about the
foot of the hill, but beyond them we could look down
into the Forum, where Virginia was stabbed, where
Horatius hung up the spoil of the Curiatii, where the
body of Julius Cæsar was burned, where the head of
Cicero was cruelly exposed on the very rostrum where
had often been seen the triumph of his eloquence.
Opposite to us stood the Palatine Hill, a mass of
crumbling palaces; a little farther off rose the mighty
wall of the Coliseum, where the gladiators used to
fight, and where so many Christian martyrs were
thrown to the wild beasts while tens of thousands of
their fellow-men, more cruel than lions, looked on, for
sport.</p>

<p>Just at the roots of the Capitoline, close by, though
out of sight, was the Mamertine Prison, where St. Paul,
of whom the world was not worthy, was once shut up
in the dismal darkness of the dungeon.</p>

<p>As we went from the garden back to the Piazza
di Campidoglio, we saw something unusual
was going on in the palace on the left of the capital.
In the door stood a guard in resplendent array of crimson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and gold lace. Looking through the arched entrance,
we could see in the inner court an open carriage
with driver and footman in livery of bright scarlet.
Something of a crowd was gathering in the corridors.
We stopped to learn what it was all about. An Italian
woman answered, “La Principessa Margarita!” and
an English lady close by explained that the Princess
Margaret, wife of the crown prince, had come to distribute
prizes to the children of the public schools.
Only invited guests could be present, but the people
were waiting to see her come down. So we joined the
people and waited also.</p>

<p>It was a long time and a pretty cold one. A brass
band in the court cheered our spirits now and then.
The fine span of the princess looked rather excited, at
first, by the trumpets so close to their ears, but they
stood their ground bravely. If one of the scarlet
footmen tightened a buckle, it raised our hopes that
his mistress was coming; the other put a fresh cigar
in his mouth, and they sank.</p>

<p>Meantime the guard in the gold-laced crimson coat
and yellow silk stockings paced up and down. At
length there was a messenger from above; the royal
carriage drove under the arch close to us. There was
a rustle, and down came the princely lady, dressed in
purple velvet, with mauve feathers in her hat, a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
veil drawn over her face, and a large bouquet in her
white-gloved hand—rather pretty, and very graceful.
Before entering her carriage, she turned to shake
hands with the ladies and gentlemen who had accompanied
her. She was very complaisant, bowing low
to them, and they still lower to her. Then she bowed
graciously to the crowd right and left, and they responded
gratefully. She smiled upon them, high and
low, but there was a look in her face, as it passed close
to me, as if she was tired of smiling for the public.
She seated herself in the carriage; the lady-in-waiting
took her place beside her, the gentleman-in-waiting
threw over them the carriage-robe of white ermine
lined with light blue velvet and stepped in himself.</p>

<p>Then the equipage rolled off, the scarlet footmen
getting up behind as it started. This princess is very
good and kind, greatly beloved by the people, and, as
there is no queen, she is the first lady in the kingdom.
Her husband first and her little son next are heirs to
the crown.</p>

<p>This show being over, we hastened back to the
church, fearing we had missed the Bambino in our
pursuit of the princess. But we were in good time.
On the side of the church opposite the tableau was a
small, temporary platform. Little boys and girls were
placed upon this, one after the other, to speak short
pieces or recite verses about the Infant Christ. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was a kind of Sunday-school concert in Italian. The
language is very sweet in a child’s mouth. There
were a great many bright, black-eyed children in the
church, and most of them seemed to have brought
their Christmas presents along with them, as if to
show them to the Bambino.</p>

<p>There were ragged men in the crowd, and monks,
and country-women with handkerchiefs tied over their
heads for bonnets. One of them who stood near me
had her first finger covered with rings up to the last
joint. That is their great ambition in the way of
dress.</p>

<p>At length the organ ceased playing, and the notes
of a military band were heard. Then we saw a banner
moving slowly down one of the aisles, followed by
a train of lighted tapers. Over the heads of the people
we could only see the banner and the lights; they
passed down and paused to take the Bambino. Then
they marched slowly all around the church—people
falling on their knees as they passed by.</p>

<p>Out at the front door they went, and that sacred
image was held high aloft, so that all the people on
the great stairway and in the square below might get
a sight of it, and be blessed. Then up the middle of
the church they came, to the high altar. This was
our chance to see them perfectly.</p>

<p>First the banner with the image of the Virgin on it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
was borne by a young priest dressed in a long black
robe and a white short gown trimmed with lace; next
came a long procession of men in ordinary dress, carrying
long and large wax candles, which they had a
disagreeable habit of dripping as they went along.</p>

<p>“Servants of great houses,” remarked a lady behind
me.</p>

<p>“They used to come themselves,” answered another.</p>

<p>Then followed Franciscan monks in their brown
copes, each with a knotted rope for a girdle, and sandals
only on his bare feet. After these came the
band of musicians, all little boys; and now approached,
with measured tread, three priests in rich
robes of white brocade, enriched with silver. The
middle one, a tall, venerable-looking man, with hoary
hair and solemn countenance, held erect in his hands
the sacred dolly. As it passed, believers dropped
upon their knees. When he reached the high altar,
he reverently kissed its feet, and delivered it to its
custodian to be carried to the Sacristy!</p>

<h2><a name="CHILDREN_UNDER_THE" id="CHILDREN_UNDER_THE">CHILDREN UNDER THE
SNOW.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">FAR away up in the north, on the shores of that
great frozen ocean lying beyond Europe and
Asia, you may sometimes catch sight (as I did once)
of a huge, gray, pointed thing, standing all alone in
the midst of the snowy plain, just like an immense
pear with the stalk upward. I should have been puzzled
had I not seen a thin curl of smoke creeping
from the top of it; but <i>that</i> let me into the secret.
This queer-looking thing was a Samoiede tent!</p>

<p>The tent of a Samoiede is almost as simple an
affair as that of an Arab. All you have to do is to
plant a dozen long poles in the ground, slanted so as
to let their tops meet; cover this framework with reindeer
skins, leaving a hole at the top to let out the
smoke; pile the snow high up around the lower part
to keep off the wind—the “house” is complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>But, outlandish as it looks, this little burrow is
worth something in a real Russian frost, which
freezes the very breath on one’s moustache; so I go
right up to the <i>door</i>, (which is simply a thick skin
hanging over a hole in the side,) lift it, and step in.</p>

<p>The inside is certainly warm enough—rather too
warm, in fact, being almost as hot and choky as a
bake-house. There is a fire burning in the middle,
the smoke going anywhere and everywhere; and
beside it sat three things, (one can hardly call them
human figures) one a deal larger than the other two.</p>

<p>There being no light but the glare of the fire, it is
not easy for me to see where I am going; and the
first thing I do is to stumble over something which
seems like a skin bag, unusually full. But it is not—it
is a <i>child</i>, wrapped or rather tied up in a huge cloak of
deer-skin, and rolling about the floor like a ball.</p>

<p>In these out-of-the-way places, where a man may
go for days without seeing a human face except his
own, people call upon each other without waiting to
be introduced; and my sudden entrance does not
seem to disturb my new friends in the least. They
greet me cordially enough, and bid me welcome in
Russian, which most of the Samoiedes speak a little;
and, seating myself on a chest, I look about me.</p>

<p>As my eyes get used to the half-light, I see that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
group by the fire consists of a woman and two little
girls, muffled in skins from head to foot. Papa is
away somewhere with his sledge and his reindeer,
leaving mamma to mind the house and take care of
the children. Funny little things they are, with great
round heads, and dark-brown skins, and small, restless
black eyes, and faces as flat as if somebody had
sat down upon them; but, queer as they look, they
have learned to make themselves useful already, for
they are hard at work stitching their own clothes.
They are not a bit shy, and in another minute I have
them scrambling up into my lap, and wondering at
the ticking of my watch, which I take out to show
them, while they clap their hands and shout “<i>Pai,
pai!</i>” which is their word for “good.”</p>

<p>The tent is not a very large one, but every inch of
its space has certainly been made the most of. The
floor is carpeted with thick sheets of gray felt, and
littered with chests, sacks, baskets, bark shoes, and
bits of harness; while hanging from the tent poles,
or thrust into the folds of the skins that cover them,
are a perfect museum of things of every sort—caps,
pouches, fish-spears, knives, hatchets, whips—and
last, but certainly not least, the face of a baby, which
has been thrust into a kind of pocket in the skin, like
a knife into the sheath. I stoop to stroke the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
brown face, while the round eyes stare wonderingly
at me out of the folds of the skin.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lady of the house (or rather tent)
hospitable like all Samoiedes, hastens to set before
me some black bread mixed with bark, and a lump of
terrifically strong cheese, made of reindeer milk.</p>

<p>The reindeer supplies the Samoiedes with plenty
of other things beside cheese; indeed, almost everything
that they have got comes from <i>it</i> in some form
or other. They eat reindeer meat, they drink reindeer
milk; their fish-spears are tipped with reindeer
horn; their clothes, and the very tents in which they
live, are made of reindeer skin; the needles wherewith
they stitch them are of reindeer bone, and the
thread of reindeer sinew; and when they wish to
move from place to place, it is the reindeer that draws
them along—the Samoiede would be as badly off
without his reindeer, as the Arab without his camel.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_JEWELLED_TOMB" id="THE_JEWELLED_TOMB">THE JEWELLED TOMB.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WOULD the youthful readers of this volume like
to hear about the most beautiful tomb in
the world?</p>

<p>It is in the city of Agra in India, on the other side
of the globe. When Boston children are eating their
lunch or playing in the sunshine at noon-recess, it is
midnight in India. It is so hot there that if anyone
happened to be awake, he would probably be fanning
himself and looking out of the window up at the stars
which are bigger and brighter than in New England, or
down at the gardens where hundreds of great fireflies
dart and whirl as if it were Fourth of July without
the noise.</p>

<p>The Jewelled Tomb was built about the time when
your great-great-grandfathers first came to Plymouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
You know how cold and bleak they found it—the
winds were stinging, the earth covered with ice and
snow, storms were on the sea and savages on the
shore. The Pilgrims made no grand tombs there;
they dared not even pile up leaves to mark their
graves as the robins did over the Babes in the Wood,
but buried their dead in wheat-fields to be hid by the
waving grain. They feared the Indians, watching to
murder and scalp them, would come at night, count
the graves and learn how few were left alive.
SHAH-Jehan, the Mogul Emperor, built the Jewelled
Tomb. His name means King of the World, because
he ruled over so many people. Jewels were like the
sand of the sea to him, he owned so many. The
Koh-i-noor, “the mountain of light,” was his, and
there is but one larger diamond in the world. The
Brahmins say that the owner of the Koh-i-noor will
always be ruler of India.</p>

<p>Shah Jehan’s soldiers and slaves could not be
counted, and there seemed no end of his cities and
palaces. One of the oldest establishments in his
dominion was a hospital for sick monkeys, where
kind nurses took care of the little mimics, cured or
made them comfortable, while they jabbered and
screeched to their hearts’ content, snatched the medicine
or choice fruits from their keepers, and plagued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
each other like wizened spoilt children. But the
great Mogul did not care so much for the health of
his subjects—he had so many it did not seem worth
while.</p>

<p>He was very fond of elephant fights, and used to
sit in a balcony overlooking the space between his
palace and the river Jumna to watch them. Sometimes
a maddened elephant had to be driven by fireworks
into the river and drowned to prevent its
trampling to death the whole crowd which had no
balcony to see from. So many riders were killed in
the sport, that one would often kiss his wife and children,
saying, “Good-by, you may never see me again—I
am going to amuse the Emperor—we have an
elephant fight to-day.” Shah-Jehan enjoyed this spectacle
whether his subjects were killed or not. His
balcony was hung with rich Persian silks. Diamonds
and riches shone in his turban and sparkled on his
breast. Every time he moved, his jewels threw rainbows
over the crowd and often into the eyes of the
combatants.</p>

<p>He had a plan of making a trellis over this balcony.
The grapes were to be amethysts, the leaves
emeralds, and the stalks pure gold. But one morning
the head goldsmith came to him, saying: “May
it please your Majesty, your trellis will take all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
emeralds and amethysts in the world.”</p>

<p>For once in his life Shah-Jehan gave up his whim
and only one bunch of grapes was ever finished.</p>

<p>This monarch loved power and splendor, but more
than all he loved his wife Moomtazee. She was the
niece of the famous Noor Mahal, and was called the
most beautiful woman in the world, and was good as
she was beautiful. “Light of the World,” “Pearl of
Women,” “Crown of Delight,” were some of the
names her husband gave her. For hours he would
sit by her side in his palace garden, on seats made
soft by cashmere shawls, finer than any that ever
crossed the ocean. They listened to the murmur of
the river; they watched the pink lilies, as large as
christening cups, that floated on its waves. Great
leaves and wonderful flowers, such as we see only in
conservatories, bent their heads beneath the spray of
the fountains. There are few singing birds in that
land, but from musicians, hidden behind the trees,
came melodies which mingled with the sound of rippling
waters.</p>

<p>All this was real, and not a story from the Arabian
Nights.</p>

<p>One evening when the glow-worms had lit their
lamps under every bush, the Mogul and his Empress
were in the garden. Their eldest daughter, best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
beloved of his children because she most resembled
her mother, was playing at their feet.</p>

<p>“Dearest Queen,” exclaimed Shah-Jehan, “here
are some flowers that I have just plucked. How
happy should I be if you could not die! You are
lovely as these roses, and I fear some day you will
fade as they do. Allah allows a little worm to
destroy a shawl that it has taken a life-time to make—if
some unseen enemy should take your life, there
would be nothing left me but a kingdom whose sun
had set.”</p>

<p>The Queen replied: “I will never leave this earth
as long as Allah will let me stay.”</p>

<p>“Jehanara,” she continued to her daughter, “if the
Angel of Death should take me from your father,
comfort and watch over him, and be all that your
mother is to the great and good Emperor.”</p>

<p>“Promise, my lord,” she said, “if I should die,
never to marry again; and place a tomb over my
grave, grand as a palace, and beautiful as these flowers
covered with diamond dew, that the whole world
may know how the greatest of earthly monarchs loved
his Moomtazee Mahal.”</p>

<p>“I promise,” said her husband, with trembling
voice, “if you should leave me, no one shall ever fill
your place, and the world has never seen so grand a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
monument as I will raise over the loveliest of women.”</p>

<p>Soon after the Queen became ill. The Emperor
was distracted when she said to him, “Remember my
two requests; now I must leave you.”</p>

<p>All the doctors and wise men in the Kingdom were
summoned, but they were so afraid their heads would
be cut off, they did not know what to do; they suggested
so many things that of course the poor Queen
stood very little chance. All the love and power of
her husband could not save her any more than if she
had been the wife of her meanest slave.</p>

<p>She died—the palace was dumb with grief. No
official dared to speak to the Emperor and tell him of
his loss. Jehanara put her arms softly around her
father’s neck and sobbed into his ear, “The Light of
the World has gone out.”</p>

<p>The funeral was scarcely over, when Shah-Jehan
began to build the tomb of his wife.</p>

<p>In our country when we think of a monument, it
is a granite shaft or a marble block; we place it in a
cemetery, and plant vines and trees around it. In
commemoration of many great and good men we
sometimes build a high monument—like that on
Bunker Hill—where we can climb to the top and
look over the country, telling each other how grand
the nation has become because of the patriots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
beneath us who gave their lives for our liberty.</p>

<p>But in India, diamonds are dug out of the earth,
precious stones filtered from streams, and pearls
fished from the seas. Every thought of nature is a
jewel, and glitters in the sunshine. The beetles are
living gems; the orange lizards that peep from under
the stones show neck-laces of brilliants. It is the
land of peacocks, whose gorgeous eyes repeat in the
sunlight all the wonders under ground. No goldsmith
can make such dazzling colors as the butterflies
carry through the air. So when the Emperor
would build a mausoleum to the Pearl of Women, he
adorned it with the most splendid gems that ever
shone even in that Land of Jewels.</p>

<p>Shah-Jehan had been collecting precious stones all
his life; but though he already had a greater number
than any one else in the world, he ransacked all
countries for more and finer gems to adorn his work.</p>

<p>He brought the most skillful architects from France
and Italy. The chief of them was Austin de
Bordeaux, named the Jewel-handed.</p>

<p>Seeds planted in the garden round the edifice
grew to be tall trees, and children who had watched the
levelling of the great platform became middle-aged
men and women before the dome was finished.
Twenty thousand workmen went home every night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
year after year, always telling their families how particular
the Emperor was that every stone should be
placed right, till at last they grew grey-headed—for
it took twenty-two years of hard work to build the
tomb.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how many millions it cost—there
are so many different estimates given—it were as
easy to tell the majorities on election night. But all
agree that it cost an enormous sum.</p>

<p>Nothing interested Shah-Jehan but this tomb of
his beautiful wife. It stood on the river Jumna in a
garden two-thirds as large as Boston Common, and
was surrounded by a red sand-stone wall high as
the roof of most houses. The Emperor used to sit
in one of the arcades on the inner side of this wall
and watch the progress of the building. Careless of
the terraced garden with its paths of variegated marble
and its eighty fountains throwing diamonds into
the air, regardless of the two mosques where Mussulmen
go to pray, his eye was always fastened upon the
dazzling structure which rose above all and gleamed
like a mountain of snow against the blue sky.</p>

<p>At length the Taje Mahal, the “Crown of Edifices,”
was completed. Let us visit it. On the side opposite
the river we pass the wall through the grand red
gate-way. It seems to be ornamented with garlands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
but looking closer you observe that what we mistook
for flowers are texts from the Koran, the Bible of
the Mahommedans. These texts are inlaid in the
stone, arranged in graceful lines, and illuminated
with colored marbles.</p>

<p>Passing through the garden, an avenue of Italian
cypresses shuts us in like a pall, while a voice from
the attendant comes out of the darkness, saying:
“Close your eyes for a moment; you will not die,
but you shall see Heaven.” Emerging from between
the trees, we mount to the platform which is raised
eighteen feet above the highest garden terrace, and
is a square of over three hundred feet, glittering and
polished as ice. At each corner and separate from
the main building rises a tall slender minaret, through
whose open carving appears the circular stairs leading
to the top. In the midst we behold the octagonal
mausoleum, surmounted by four small cupolas around
the central dome, which towers as high as Bunker
Hill monument.</p>

<p>Where we stand above the world, everything
beneath our feet and around us is made of white
marble. There is no tinge of color on the four minarets,
but within them the central pile is covered with
delicate traceries that look like flowering vines.
They are verses from the Koran; every letter is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
black marble inlaid in the white, and ornamented
with jasper, agate, cornelian and lapis-lazuli. When
we are told that the whole sacred book is written in
this way upon the Taje Mahal, we understand why
the work took twenty years.</p>

<p>There is an entrance north, south, east and west.
Crossing the threshold of either, we see that the vast
interior is divided into several apartments. Beneath
each of the four small domes is a separate enclosure.
Under the central dome an octagonal space is shut
in by colonades roofed with arches. High above
you, in the very centre of this great dome, flashes a
golden ornament like a constellation of stars. The
floor, the walls, the columns, the ceiling, all are of
glistening white marble. About seventy-five feet from
the floor a carved trellis-work around the base of the
dome lights the place, and shows the whole interior
to be a mosaic of texts. They are made of black
letters; not straight like those in a printed book, but
twisted like the tendrils of a vine; and in this central
and more sacred chamber, precious stones of every
color gleam and sparkle around the words as if from
a thorny stem gay flowers had sprung on every side.
The buds and leaves look so natural as to deceive
the eye. You wonder if the whole building has been
decorated for a victory; if those are garlands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
evergreens and flowers that cross the arches, drip over
the freizes, interlace each other and almost wave in the
breeze—and if they are for a Christmas festival?</p>

<p>The great Mogul placed them on these walls, and
they are enduring as his love.</p>

<p>You seem to look at banks of snow overspread
with wreaths of flowers which the sun, streaming
through the high trellised windows, transforms into
foaming cataracts falling from the sky, while braided
rainbows flash and dance on their waves.</p>

<p>On the floor, under the dome, is an octagonal
screen, higher than a tall man, and made of marble
as delicately wrought as a veil of lace. It is bordered
with lilies, tulips and roses, made of precious
stones. Within this screen, beneath the centre of the
dome, is a slab of marble six feet in length.</p>

<p>The poor mother covers her darling’s grave with
flowers—all she can give; they fade, and she still
keeps fresh tokens there. The flowers the great
Mogul placed on the grave of his Queen were made
of the most costly jewels. The finest rubies that he
had searched the world to procure, glowed in a rose
near the head, close by an emerald lotus leaf covered
with diamond spray. Texts from the Koran, always
in black letters, form an inlaid back ground of
thorns for the flowers. Mahometans believe these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
texts make the grave more sacred, and are a charm
to preserve it from injury. On the end of the slab
next the door are conspicuous the words, “Deliver
us from the tribe of unbelievers.”</p>

<p>No royal lady’s brooch was ever of more delicate
workmanship than this casket of jewels. It glitters
in the marble hall like a clustre of diamonds on a
robe of white satin. Sparks of light dart on the
screen, kindle the tracery into fire; tongues of flame
speak on the floor; points of vivid light live all over
the building and transfigure it into glory.</p>

<p>In a vault below this great hall, and just under the
precious slab, Queen Moomtazee is buried. A lamp
is always burning over her tomb, and a priest, whose
white beard falls below his waist, chants from the
Koran. A strange echo repeats his voice back and
forth in the church above, till it seems to linger in
the lofty dome, where an invisible choir whisper his
words before they take flight to Heaven.</p>

<p>Shah-Jehan never married again. The tomb for
his wife so occupied his thoughts that he did not
know that the greatest empire in the world was slipping
away from him. The Princess Jehanara kept
her promise to her mother. Father and daughter
daily laid fresh flowers on the jewelled slab in the
Taje Mahal, and the starry roses watched the frail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
living ones close their eyes and droop, while their
own petals never faded.</p>

<p>The kingly mourner was dethroned by his crafty,
cruel son, Aurengzebe, who became Emperor, and
imprisoned his father in the very palace from which
he used to watch the elephant fights. He had no
solace in confinement but his faithful daughter.
Every day he looked with infinite longing at the minarets
of the mausoleum. He could see the dome
which rose high above the grave of his Queen, but
he could never lay a flower there. For eight years
he could see the outside of his master-piece of architecture,
but never again did his eyes behold the
jewelled grave, which is the central thought, the
heart of the Taje Mahal.</p>

<p>The Moguls no longer rule in the East. The
Koh-i-noor, the ransom of a royal captive, belongs to
Queen Victoria—the Empress of India.</p>

<p>The different conquerors of that country have
destroyed many a marble palace, burnt many a beautiful
city; but all of them, even the furious Sepoys,
have left unharmed the Taje Mahal—the jewelled
wonder, and it stands to-day in its perfect glory—the
monument raised by the love of an Eastern
despot to his beautiful wife.</p>

<h2><a name="A_NIGHT_WITH_PAUL_BOYTON" id="A_NIGHT_WITH_PAUL_BOYTON">A NIGHT WITH PAUL BOYTON.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“TELL me, what was the oddest experience you
ever had?” said a friend of mine one day,
upon the cars going West.</p>

<p>I had been “spinning yarns” to him, as the sailors
say, for the last hundred miles of our journey, concerning
a variety of queer happenings met with in
the life of a journalistic Free-lance during the past
ten years.</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s a hard question to answer,”
said I: “give me five minutes to think. Let’s see—did
I ever tell you about my cruise with Paul
Boyton?”</p>

<p>Paul Boyton is the man, you know, with the rubber
life-saving rig; has rescued lots of people from
drowning; floated down most of the rivers of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and a good many in this country. My night’s trip
with him was about the strangest adventure that I
could recall.</p>

<p>I first met Boyton at one of the towns upon the
St. John’s river in Florida. We were having a
game of billiards together, when some whim prompted
me to say:</p>

<p>“Mr. Boyton, I’d like to take a cruise with you
sometime.”</p>

<p>To my surprise, and perhaps not exactly to my
liking, he at once assented.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s easily done. I always have a spare
suit along. We can go to-morrow, if you like.”</p>

<p>Several of my acquaintances were within hearing,
and I saw they would have a laugh at my expense
if I backed down; so I responded with equal
promptitude:</p>

<p>“All right, just count me in; but say, I don’t
want to leave from here. The whole town will be
down at the wharf watching me floating about like
a sick turtle. That would never do.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/i-236.jpg" width="309" height="442" alt="man with double-ended paddle" />
<div class="caption">PAUL BOYTON.</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh,” said the jolly captain, “I’ll fix that. You
shall have a paddle, and when you are tired I’ll tow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
you; besides, we will start after dark if you want to;
we can go down with the tide. It will be running out
at a lively rate about then.”</p>

<p>Now I had no notion I would be taken up so suddenly
by Captain Boyton; and although I did my best
to look happy at the prospect, I am afraid it was a
sorry effort.</p>

<p>A man in Texas described to me, once, his feelings
after engaging to fight a duel; and I suppose that my
sensations and reflections were, during the succeeding
twenty-four hours, not unlike his. I lay in bed that
night and thought of the watery couch that had been
chosen for my next resting-place.</p>

<p>It was a long, very long night, full of forebodings
and regrets. In the morning the clerk of the hotel
kindly inquired if I wished my effects sent home by
express, or detained until my friends could arrive “for
the body;” the folks at the breakfast-table rallied
me about it; and some of my acquaintances made
bets that I would back out. When I went down
the main street it seemed as though every one was
pointing a finger at me, with a look that said
plainly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the fellow that’s going to commit suicide
to-night!”</p>

<p>It was about half-past six in the evening when we
emerged from a building close beside the water, the
captain leading, and his victim, as he humorously
called me, following close behind, escorted by a single
lantern and a group of friends. The lantern cast
a gloomy ray out upon the black surface of the river,
and gave the two principal figures in their rubber
disguises the aspect of some fabled amphibious monsters.</p>

<p>The suits were made in two parts, joined at the
waist by a round iron band, over which the rubber-cloth
was so well secured as to be quite water-tight.
The head was covered by a hood, concealing all but
the eyes, mouth, and nose. In the back of the head-piece
there was an air-chamber, which, when filled,
gave the voyager a very comfortable pillow. Along
the sides were two more large air-chambers, and still
a couple below, to support the legs.</p>

<div class="caption">SEEING THEM OFF.</div>
</div>

<p>Just as soon as we were in, or rather <i>upon</i>, the
water, all sense of trepidation vanished. As the tide
drifted us away from the noisy group upon the wharf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and into the darkness, I was able to wave my paddle
and reply to their repartee right heartily. I felt quite
happy at the novelty of the thing; but wait—one of
the boys shouts:</p>

<p>“Look out as you pass the point. I saw a big
‘’gator’ there yesterday. Keep towards the middle!”</p>

<p><i>Alligators!</i> I hadn’t, in all my wild forebodings,
taken them into consideration. A <i>creepy</i> sensation
pervaded my back and travelled down to my toes.
“What if—oh! I wish he hadn’t shouted that,”
thought I.</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate the captain’s ahead; they’ll
get him first, and maybe I’ll have a chance while
they are lunching from him!” So I turned around
and remarked casually:</p>

<p>“I guess, Cap. you had better keep a little ahead.
You know the way better than I do!”</p>

<p>But somehow the captain had disappeared. I
shouted, and paddled rapidly in the direction I supposed
him to be. No answer!</p>

<p>“I believe the alligators have got him already,”
thought I; and you should have seen the way that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
paddle went through the water, driving me back toward
the distant wharf where the lantern still twinkled.
My foot encountered something.</p>

<p>Oh, <i>horrors!</i> what a yell I gave! You can wager
that brief second will never be forgotten. No, sir!
But it was only a stray log; and just then the captain’s
merry laugh resounded over the water close at
hand, as he came floating toward me, delighted with
the success of his trick; and he began to sing a song
of his own composing, improvising the music and
splashing his paddle in time to his melody:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I’ll take my sleep on the rolling deep,</div>
<div class="verse">Your downy couch let others keep;</div>
<div class="verse">My paddle true will guide me through,</div>
<div class="verse">My life-garb is better than any canoe;—</div>
<div class="verse">Whoop! hurrah! yes, than any canoe!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The echoes of the refrain died away among the
woods of the far opposite shore, startling a brood
of wild fowl from their rest in the sedge of the
bayou.</p>

<p>Now the captain turned and said, “Let’s give ’em a
rocket!”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-244.jpg" width="500" height="337" alt="men in water; rocket going off" />
<div class="caption">>“LET’S GIVE THEM A ROCKET.”</div>
</div>

<p>I have forgotten to tell you that the captain had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
tow a miniature craft, which he fondly called <i>Baby
Mine</i>. It was made of tin, and was altogether a
miraculous sort of boat, as I soon discovered, for it
held all sorts of things one might want for comfort
upon or <i>in</i> the water.</p>

<p><i>Baby Mine</i> was entirely decked in, having a tin
“hatch,” into which the captain put his hand and
produced a small lamp, which was fitted to a groove
in the bows. This was lighted by means of matches,
and a rocket next appeared. The latter was fixed
in an upright position upon <i>Baby Mine</i>. The captain
held the boat with one hand and touched off the
rocket with the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whiz-z-z-z-z!</span></p>

<p>And away it sped into the black sky above, and then:</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i></p>

<p>A myriad of tiny sparkles flew outward and then
fell slowly, streaking the sky for a moment with a rainbow
of fire. We could see in the pallid light the
group that still lingered upon the wharf, half a
mile away.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Boyton, “let’s have a little stage
effect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>So he took from the interior of <i>Baby Mine</i> a tin
saucer and a wooden float, as well as some powder
in a small bottle. He poured a little of the latter
upon the dish and set it upon the float. A match was
applied to a short fuse. As soon as ignited, the powder
cast a brilliant lurid glow over the wavelets,
and we seemed to be floating in a literal sea
of blood. In the midst of this—shall I ever
forget that ludicrous sight?—was the captain,
grimacing out of his hood like some horrid
satyr, and wagging his two black paws like a great
pair of ears. I can’t do the subject justice. Perhaps
you may have dreamed of some such personage
after taking a late and too hearty supper.</p>

<p>All of this time the captain had been standing upright
in the water, head and shoulders out, looking as
firm as though he was upon the bottom, although I
knew the river must be at least forty feet deep where
we were.</p>

<p>“Now you must learn how to stand,” said he; and
after a few failures I was able to take an upright position
or lie down at will.</p>

<p>The tide had soon carried us beyond the point and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
its fabled alligators, at which the captain laughed
with contempt.</p>

<p>“Look at this knife,” cried he. “I’ve killed <i>sharks</i>
with this, and wouldn’t be afraid to try it on an alligator.”
He produced a long, peculiar Turkish blade
from his belt, and made a lunge at an imaginary
saurian.</p>

<p>The moon had now cleared the low-hanging mists
of the night, and we could see our course fairly well.
Ahead of us we noticed a second point, and oh, listen!
out of its reeds there came the sound of some heavy
body, and something black moved from the shore. It
made an ominous splashing as it came towards us.
Even the brave captain, forgetful of his knife and
boast, eyed it dubiously. I shook all over; the water
seemed to have suddenly become as cold as ice.
Just then the captain’s cheerful laugh came like music
to my ears.</p>

<p>“That isn’t an alligator;” he whispered, “it’s a
darkey in a dug-out. Keep quiet, and we’ll have
some fun.”</p>

<p>The captain quickly and silently produced his pan
and red fire. We floated like logs on the water until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the boatman had almost reached us, and then a sudden
and unaccountable blaze sprang out of the waters
before his horrified gaze, while two undoubted demons
emerged and waved their arms towards him
with horrid groans.</p>

<p>It was enough—far more than enough. With a
screech of terror the black man sprang from his boat
and struck out for shore, uttering dismal entreaties
to “good Mister Debbil” not to “ketch him yet,”
with every plunge; and despite our calls, he broke
through the reeds, clambered up the bank, and was
soon lost to hearing in the dense forest.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I think of it, I wonder if that
chap is running yet; but I guess he brought up somewhere,
for we heard soon afterwards that there was a
great gathering of the negroes, and that one of
their speakers had seen a couple of monsters rising
out of the waters of the St. John’s, commanding
him to tell the people the world was coming to an
end.</p>

<div class="caption">SUDDEN AND UNACCOUNTABLE.</div>
</div>

<p>“Now that was rather lively, hey?” mused the captain;
“but I’m sorry we scared him so. I wonder
what’s in his boat? We’re pirates now, to all intents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
and purposes, and may as well take our plunder.
A bag of potatoes—no, oranges, just what I wanted.
No wonder he ran so—he’s been into one of the
groves over there. I wonder if it’s stealing to steal
from a thief? Let’s have some supper. I nearly
forgot about supper.”</p>

<p>A loose plank was taken from the dug-out, and out
of the wonderful depths of <i>Baby Mine</i> emerged
the following items:</p>

<ul class="storylist">
<li>A quart bottle of cold coffee,</li>
<li>A can of condensed milk,</li>
<li>Some loaf-sugar,</li>
<li>A tin box of cheese,</li>
<li>Four biscuits,</li>
<li>A pot of marmalade,</li>
<li>Some chipped beef,</li>
<li>A half-dozen boiled eggs,</li>
<li>Pickles, pepper and salt,</li>
<li>Spoons,</li>
<li>Knives,</li>
<li>Tin cups,</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>“The company will please sit down, and excuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the holes in the cloth, and not put their elbows on
the table,” said the jolly captain, as he held the coffee
over the lamp while I ‘set’ the table.</p>

<p>“Now, here we go! What an appetite I’ve got!
Don’t lean back in your chair, my boy, one of the legs
is gone; you might upset. I wish that chap had
stayed. He might have taken tea with us, at least.
Halloo! I’ve struck bottom. We’re right in shore. I
guess the tide’s about ebb!” and so the merry fellow
rattled on, taking a look at his watch, which hung
upon some peg in the cabin of <i>Baby Mine</i>.</p>

<p>What a surpassingly beautiful place we had drifted
into! A cove, surrounded upon three sides by great
water oaks that bent their long arms down towards
the tide, draped in sad but rich festoons of gray
Spanish moss. The pale forms of dead cypress
trees, swathed in wild grape-vines, leaned over, and
fragrant magnolia branches mingled their dark and
glossy leaves through all the fairy tracery of branch
and palm, displayed like dark embroidery against the
moonlit heavens. How I wished the boys could be
there to see us now!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 553px;">

<div class="caption">TAKING TEA WITH CAPTAIN BOYTON.</div>
</div>

<p>It was altogether the queerest supper I ever swallowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
From the still well-stored depths of the tin
boat the captain produced a cigar-case, and presently
we reclined at ease upon our aqueous couch, waiting
for the tide to run in again. What tales the captain told
that night, as we lay there! what recitals of his adventures
in other lands; of receptions by monarchs;
of his famous voyage down the terrible and mysterious
Tagus; of the queer people he met in
the Spanish provinces; of his feats in Russia—why!
I could fill a book with them.</p>

<p>About two o’clock we found ourselves drifting
out into the river again, and were soon making
good headway towards home. For an hour we
paddled side by side, but my unaccustomed arms
began to fail, and then the captain unwound a
blue-fish line from a reel and tied it to my foot,
so he towed me along; and released from the
need of action, I lay upon my snug air-pillow and
watched the waning moon.</p>

<p>Just as the early tints began to paint the eastern
sky, foretelling the coming of sunrise (will you believe
me?), I actually fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I aroused myself it was quite light and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
were passing the last point; and there, upon a
log, lay stretched out my friend’s alligator, gazing
sleepily at us, but never deigning to move.</p>

<p>I wonder if he realized what a dainty meal he
might have had!</p>

<h2><a name="BOY-DIVERS_IN_THE_RED" id="BOY-DIVERS_IN_THE_RED">BOY-DIVERS IN THE RED
SEA.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“HERE we are at last, Mr. Ker,” says the captain,
as we cast anchor off the coast of Arabia, a
little after sunset, about two-thirds down the Red Sea.
“It’s too dark to make out much to-night, but you’ll
see a rare sight when you come on deck to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>The worthy captain’s mention of “coming on
deck” is doubtless from force of habit, for neither he
nor I have been anywhere <i>but</i> on deck for more than a
week, except perhaps to look for something which we
have left below. Most of my time is spent in the
rigging, where what little wind there is may generally
be met with; and our table-cloth is spread on the
“after-hatch,” while our arrangements for going to
bed consist merely of throwing a blanket on the deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>,
and stretching ourselves upon it, undisturbed save by
an occasional scamper of two or three frolicsome rats
over our faces.</p>

<p>When I awake the next morning, I find the captain’s
promise amply made good. The sun is just
rising, and under its golden splendor the broad blue
sea stretches westward as far as eye can reach, every
ripple tipped with living fire. On the other side extends
a sea of another kind—the gray, unending
level of the great Arabian desert, melting dimly into
the warm dreamy sky. In front, the low white wall
of a Turkish fort stands out like an ivory carving
against the hot brassy yellow of the sand-hills that
line the shore; while all around it are the little cabins
of mud-plastered wickerwork that compose the Arab
village, looking very much like hampers left behind
by some monster picnic. Here and there, through
the light green of the shallower water along the shore,
a flash of dazzling white, keen and narrow as the edge
of a sword, marks the presence of the dangerous
coral-reefs among which we have been picking our
way for the last three days, with the chance of running
aground at any moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“You were right, captain,” say I, as the burly
skipper rises and stretches his brawny arms, like a
bear awaking from its winter nap. “This is a sight
worth seeing, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>this</i> ain’t what I meant,” chuckles the captain;
“the best o’ the show’s to come yet. Look
over yonder—there, just ’twixt the reef and the
shore. D’ye see anything in the water?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I see something swimming—sharks,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Sharks, eh? Well, <i>land</i>-sharks you might call
’em, p’raps. Take my glass and try again.”</p>

<p>The first look through the glass works a startling
change. In a moment the swarm of round black
spots which I have ignorantly taken for the backs of
sharks, are turned into <i>faces</i>—the faces of Arab
children, and (as I perceive with no little amazement)
of very young children too, some of the smallest being
apparently not more than five or six years old!
Our vessel is certainly not less than a mile from the
shore, and the water, shallow as it is, is deep enough
at any point to drown the very tallest of these adventurous
little “water-babies;” yet they are evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
making for the ship, and that, too, at a speed that
will soon bring them alongside of her.</p>

<p>“Are they really coming all this way out without
resting?” ask I.</p>

<p>“Bless you, that’s nothing to an Arab!” laughs the
captain; “these little darkies are as much at home in
the water as on land. I’ve heard folks talk a good
deal of the way the South Sea Islanders can swim;
but I’ve seen as good swimming here as ever I saw there.”</p>

<p>And now, as the Lilliputian swimmers draw nearer,
we begin to hear their shrill cries and elfish laughter;
and now they are close enough for their little brown
faces, and glittering teeth, and beady black eyes, to
be easily distinguished; and now one final stroke
of their lean sinewy arms carries them alongside,
and the blue water swarms with tiny figures, looking
up and waving their hands so eagerly that one might
almost expect to hear them call out, “Shine, boss?”
and see them produce a brush and a pot of blacking.
But instead of that, there is a universal chorus of
“<i>Piastre, Howadji!</i>” (a penny, my lord!)</p>

<p>“Chuck ’em a copper, and you’ll see something
good!” says the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>I rummage the few remaining pockets of my tattered
white jacket, and at last unearth a Turkish piastre
(5 cts.) which I toss into the water. Instantly the
smooth bright surface is dappled with a forest of tiny
brown toes, all turning upward at once, and down
plunge the boy-divers, their supple limbs glancing
through the clear water like a shoal of fish.</p>

<p>By this time nearly all the crew are looking over
the side, and encouraging the swimmers with lusty
shouts; for, used as Jack is to all sorts of queer spectacles,
this is one of which he seems never to
tire.</p>

<p>“There’s one of ’em got it!”</p>

<p>“No, he ain’t!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has—I see him a-comin’ up with it!”</p>

<p>“And there’s the others a-tryin’ to take it from him—hold
tight, Sambo!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, the successful diver is surrounded
by three or four piratical comrades, who are doing
their best to snatch away the hard-won coin; but he
sticks to it like a man, and as he reaches the surface,
holds it up to us triumphantly, and then pops it into
his mouth—the only pocket he has got.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>But this is a sad mistake on his part. In a
moment a crafty companion swims up behind him,
and tickles him under the chin. As his mouth opens,
out drops the coin into his assailant’s hand, from
whom it is instantly snatched by some one else; and
a regular bear-fight ensues in the water, which splashes
up all around them like a fountain-jet, while their
shouts and laughter make the air ring.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they afraid of sharks?” ask I of the captain,
who has just increased the confusion tenfold by
throwing another copper into the very midst of the
screaming throng.</p>

<p>“Not they—they make too much row for any
shark to come near <i>them</i>. Sharks are mighty easy
scared, for all they’re so savage. You’ll never catch
’em coming too near a steamer when she’s goin’—the
flappin’ of the screw frightens ’em away. See,
there’s two of ’em comin’ along now, and you’ll just
see how much the boys’ll care for ’em.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, the sudden uprising of those gaunt
black fins, piercing the smooth water as with an unexpected
stab, seems to produce no effect whatever
upon these fearless urchins, who paddle about as unconcerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
the sharks themselves have other business to attend
to. A shoal of flying-fish come driving past, glistening
like rainbows in the dazzling sunshine as they
leap out of the water and fall back again. Instantly
one of the “sea-lawyers” dashes at the rear of the
column, while the other, wheeling around its front,
heads back the fugitives into his comrade’s open
jaws; and in this way the two partners contrive to
make a very respectable “haul.”</p>

<p>But at this moment the garrison-boat is seen putting
off from the shore, with one of the Pasha’s officers in
the stern-sheets. At sight of the well-known official
flag, our water-babies scatter like wild-fowl, and the
next moment all the little black heads are seen bobbing
over the shining ripples on their way back to
the shore.</p>

<h2><a name="ST_BOTOLPHS_TOWN" id="ST_BOTOLPHS_TOWN">ST. BOTOLPH’S TOWN.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">LONG time ago, there were in England, as well
as in many other countries, certain pious men
and women who, for their eminent wisdom, charitable
works, or lives of purity and usefulness, came to be
called Saints.</p>

<p>Among these was a Saxon monk, the Abbot of
Ikanho, St. Botolph by name, who lived about the
middle of the seventh century.</p>

<p>Botolph belonged to a noble English family.
After having been educated at one of the religious
houses in what was then called Belgic Gaul, he came
back to England, and begged of King Ethelmund a
barren spot on which to build a monastery; and
here, on the Witham River, near the eastern coast of
England, in what is now called Lincolnshire, he
built his priory, and founded a town to which was
given the name, St. Botolph’s Town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Here is what an unknown poet says of it in Longfellow’s
<i>Poems of Places:</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“St. Botolph’s Town!—Hither across the plains</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And fens of Lincolnshire, in garb austere,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There came a Saxon monk, and founded here</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A priory, pillaged by marauding Danes,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So that thereof no vestige now remains;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Only a name, that spoken loud and clear,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And echoed in another hemisphere,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Survives the sculptured walls and painted panes.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">St. Botolph’s Town!—Far over leagues of land</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And leagues of sea looks forth its noble tower,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And far around the chiming bells are heard.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now as the English people have a queer way of
shortening names, as the years go on, that reminds
one of the riddle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Little Nan Etticoat has a white petticoat</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 5em;">And a red nose.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The longer she stands the shorter she grows.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In process of time old St. Botolph’s Town became
reduced to simply <i>Boston</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>So now you see that that “echo in another hemisphere”
of St. Botolph’s Town is, of course, the name
of our own Boston, so called by its early English settlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
in memory of the English Boston they had left
behind them; though, as those of you who have read
Higginson’s History know, it had at first borne the
name of Trimountain, because of its three hills; its
Indian name having been Mushauwomuck, shortened,
English fashion, to Shawmut. Boston school-boys,
never forget that the original Indian name meant
Free-country, or Free-land!</p>

<p>The name Botolph means “<i>Boat-help;</i>” and so, in
those old times St. Botolph came to be deemed the
patron saint of mariners; and as both Bostons are
commercial cities by the sea, it is eminently appropriate
that they should bear the old Boat-helper’s name.
Perhaps, too, that is why “Simon Kempthorn,
Mariner,” in Longfellow’s <i>New England Tragedy</i> of
<i>John Endicott</i>, cries out, when a fire is kindled in
Boston’s Market Place, in the year 1656, to burn the
religious books of the persecuted Quakers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">“Rain, rain, rain,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Bones of St. Botolph, and put out this fire!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(Would not that quotation make a capital motto for
a Boston Fire Company!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The English Boston has a high church-tower, one
of the most beautiful in England,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The loftiest tower of Britain’s isle,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In valley or on steep.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It resembles the tower of Antwerp Cathedral, and
is crowned by a beautiful octagonal lantern, that can
be seen forty miles off. It serves, therefore, as a
landmark for seamen.</p>

<p>Another poet in <i>Poems of Places</i> says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“Beneath that lordly tower</span></div>

<p>And now I have to tell you of what seems to me a
pleasing and surprising coincidence:</p>

<p>In the Catholic calendar each saint has his special
day; thus, you know we have St. Valentine’s Day, on
Feb. 14th, when you send the pretty valentines; St.
Patrick’s Day, March 17th, when our Irish citizens
march in processions, “wearing of the green;”
St. John’s Day, June 24th, when the Canadians
among us make wreaths and garlands of the fresh
young maple-leaves, because the maple is the Canadian
emblem. Now it so happens that St. Botolph’s
Day is, of all days in the year for the American
Boston’s patron saint—what do you think? <i>The
Seventeenth of June!</i></p>

<p>That Seventeenth of June, when Boston puts on
her very best gala dress, when the bells all ring, and
the Fire Companies form into processions, and the
Military march, and the orators make speeches, and
the children sing, and the great organ makes grand
patriotic music, and the stars and stripes are flung to
the “Boston east-winds,” and the holiday is a jolly
day!</p>

<p>Now do not you agree with me that we have found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a delightful triple coincidence, in that Boston’s great
holiday is Bunker Hill Day; and Bunker Hill Day is
the Seventeenth of June; and the Seventeenth of
June is old St. Botolph’s Day?</p>

<h2><a name="SOME_QUEER_AMERICANS" id="SOME_QUEER_AMERICANS">SOME QUEER AMERICANS.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE queerest people in this country, I fancy, live
down in the southern part of the Blue Ridge
where that magnificent range of mountains passes
through the northern parts of both Carolinas and of
Georgia. Even their houses are small and queer, and
all their tools and machinery of the most primitive
description.</p>

<p>The farm-houses through the mountains are made
of logs, and, as the weather is not usually very cold,
the chinking of mud and chips between the logs is
very likely to fall out and be only half replaced, so
that in the storms of winter, they must be comfortless
abodes; but, as I said, the cold comes mainly in the
shape of sudden storms after which there is a warm
spell. You remember, that when the stranger asked
Kit, the famous “Arkansas Traveller,” why he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
patch the hole in his roof, he answered “that it had
been so all-fired rainy he couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“But why don’t you now that it doesn’t rain?”</p>

<p>“Because now it don’t leak!” cried Kit triumphantly,
and went on with his fiddling.</p>

<p>Well, that is a very good example of the spirit
which builds these houses and tries to keep them—not
in repair exactly, but at least upright. I am
speaking of the ordinary farm-houses in the mountains.
Now and then you will see more snug and pretentious
ones, but not often even among men who own several
hundred acres of land and a large number of cows,
horses and sheep. Sometimes they build two log huts
pretty close together, and roof over the space between,
making an open hall-way or store-shed, where saddles,
and dried fruit are hung, and where all sorts of
things are placed out of the rain or sun. In nearly
every case, too, the roof of the front side of the house
is continued out into a broad shed, where benches
are placed, and half the household work is done
I have often seen the loom upon which they wove
their homespun clothes filling up half the space in
this broad porch, and shaded by masses of morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
glory, Virginia creeper or columbine. A low log
house with one of these long-roofed porches reminds
one of a man with a slouched hat pulled down over
his eyes.</p>

<p>Whether the house is large or small; such as I
have described or better than that; you will be sure
to see the chimney wholly on the outside. It stands
at the end of the house, and is a huge pile of stone
set in mortar or perhaps only a conglomerate of
sticks and stones and mud, half as wide as the house
itself at the base, and then narrowing somewhat to
the summit six or eight feet above the gable. The
great summer house of Mr. John C. Calhoun, the
famous senator who died about twenty years ago, has
two of these big outside chimneys made of brick; and
this mansion was considered a very grand one in
its day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 413px;">
<img src="images/i-274.jpg" width="413" height="328" alt="house and famer" />
<div class="caption">“SWEET HOME” IN THE MOUNTAINS.</div>
</div>

<p>If you should go inside—and the women and
children are very hospitable to strangers—you would
find little evidence of what we in the north call comfort.
There will be one large room, serving as sitting-room,
dining-room and kitchen, nearly one whole
side of which will be given up to the vast fireplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
which is hollowed into the broad chimney. On the
opposite side from the fire, perhaps, will be a little
bedroom partitioned off, but often not, and the only
other room in the house will be the rough boarded
attic overhead, reached by a ladder. Lathing and
plastering are hardly known outside the few villages,
and carpets are still more rare. A bedstead or two,
some splint-bottomed home-made chairs, as straight-backed
and uncomfortable as possible, a rough table
and some benches complete the furniture. Stoves
are not yet known to the mountaineers. They cling
to the old-fashioned way of cooking at the open fireplace,
hanging the iron pot in which they boil their
food over the fire upon a swinging iron arm fixed in
the side of the chimney and called a “crane;” or if
they want to roast a spare-rib of beef or pork, hanging
that by a hook upon the crane, and steadily turning
it round until it is evenly done.</p>

<p>Another favorite dish is the hoe-cake or corn-dodger,
which is a batter-cake of corn-meal baked
before the open fire, or in the bottom of the iron pot.
Wheat flour is almost unknown in some of these
mountain districts, cornmeal and sorghum molasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
wholly taking its place. The mills where it is ground
are the most picturesque and seemingly useless affairs.
Every mile or so through these rough hills there
comes tumbling down a clear and rapid stream, so
that water-power is plenty enough for each man to
have his own mill, and most of them are essentially
home-made. I saw one over near the sources of
the Chestatee which from the outside looked far more
like a heap of old drifted logs than anything else.
The man who ran it built the whole affair himself,
with only an axe, a saw and a two-inch auger for
tools. The entire running-gear was wooden, yet this
mill had stood many years and ground all the corn of
the neighborhood. Such machinery is slow and weak
of course, but the people who use it have plenty of
time. They can’t understand the hurry and anxiety
to save time which characterize their more thrifty
neighbors who live <i>in</i> the world instead of alongside
of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/i-278.jpg" width="456" height="310" alt="three women and man inside house" />
<div class="caption"> INTERIOR.</div>
</div>

<p>A boy who was not born in the mountains, and was
used to livelier motions, took some corn to one of
these Georgia mills to be ground not long ago, succeeded
in waking the miller up, getting the wheel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
motion and his grist in the hopper. Then, expecting
a long delay, he wandered off. But when he came
back his meal was not half ready and he became impatient.</p>

<p>“My chickens—and thar ain’t but two of ’em
either—would eat meal faster’n yer mill’ll grind it!”</p>

<p>“How long could they keep it up?” asked the
miller.</p>

<p>“Until they starved to death,” replied the smart
boy.</p>

<p>This is the only boy, however, whom I ever heard
complain of the slowness of life there, for none of
them are accustomed to anything faster, except when
they are on horseback. Then the young chaps make
the road fly from under them, and ride their fine
horses with great spirit. On horseback is the usual
method of travel, indeed, for the roads over the
mountains are exceedingly rough, and to many farms
there is hardly any road at all for wheels.</p>

<p>One day we were riding gayly along on a couple of
the excellent saddle-horses that are so common
among these hills, when we came to the banks of the
Etowah river. There was no bridge, and the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
led right down to the low banks, and through the
amber-clear water we could see the tracks of the
wagons which had crossed before us. I had heard
of the Etowah many times as one of the most beautiful
rivers of Georgia, and I am glad to pass the reputation
along. I remembered, also, that in place of
the beads of wood, soapstone and various sorts of
shell which are dug up as the remains of some Indian
girl’s necklace, or red man’s earring, on the banks of
this river beads of pure gold had been found. The
Indians here were rich—they had golden ornaments
instead of shell-wampum; but their gold proved their
ruin, for the poor Cherokees were driven away as
soon as their wealth was discovered and white men
hastened to wash the sands of this troubled river.
But I did not set out to describe the gold mines, but
only to show why the Etowah particularly interested
me, and why I was glad to find it equal to its praise.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/i-282.jpg" width="353" height="492" alt="Mill" />
<div class="caption">GRIST-MILL ON THE CHESTATEE.</div>
</div>

<p>However, I was not given much time for quiet
delight. On the bank, by the side of the road, sat
two lank and rough-looking Georgians with scowls
on their faces. As we trotted near they rose up and
came to meet us, while one sung out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, mister, can’t yer set weuns acrost tha’? Weem
ben waitin’ hyar I reckon about two hours, and them
lazy fellars”—pointing over to where half a dozen men
lay stretched out in the sun, smoking, with a small
boat drawn up on the beach—“wouldn’t pay no ’tention
to our yellin’. Just let go o’ your stirrup will you?”</p>

<p>Evidently he did not propose to lose this chance,
for before I could move my foot he had pulled away
the stirrup, seized the cantle of the saddle and swung
himself behind me, astride my surprised horse. The
other man did the same thing by my friend, and
there we were, captured by the long arms that reached
easily all round our waists, and had several inches to
spare.</p>

<p>“Get up,” my passenger shouted, digging his heels
into my nag’s flanks in a way that started him into
the water with a very sudden splash, and on we went.
The river was pretty deep in the middle, but we
picked up our feet and got safely across to where the
smokers grinned at the trouble their lazy discourtesy
had forced upon us, as at a good joke. Then my man
skipped off to the ground, and sliding his hand into
a ragged pocket, asked with a whine:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/i-286.jpg" width="274" height="460" alt="four men on two horses crossing water" />
<div class="caption">A LIFT OVER THE FORD.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you charge?”</p>

<p>I doubt if he had a penny about him, for he seemed
greatly relieved when I very quickly assured him he
was welcome to his ferriage.</p>

<p>“Do you know who those fellows were?” asked
my companion, as we cantered up the gravelly hill;
“my man told me that they were both preachers.”</p>

<p>“Preachers!” I said. “I took them for moonshiners
at the very least.”</p>

<p>But now and then a vehicle so strange as to bring
a laugh upon the faces of even the neighbors
will come down from the backwoods. The cart will have
only two large heavy wheels, and these alone of all
its parts will be shop-made. The massive axle-tree,
and pole or shafts and the rough box were made at
home—perhaps wholly chopped out with an axe and
fastened together with wooden pins. You must not
expect to see a horse or a span of horses drawing
this odd, unpainted cart—if the owner has horses,
he probably considers them worthy of the saddle
only—but oxen, or an ox and cow, or only one of
either sex; I heard, indeed, of one case where a cow
and a donkey were hitched up together, but that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
certainly extraordinary. A single cow in the traces
makes the funniest picture, I think. The harness
will be partly leather, partly rope, perhaps eked out
with twisted bark, and from the horns a single thin
rope goes back to the driver, who can thus keep his
beast awake by frequent jerks. Sometimes when the
mountaineer and his wife go to market they place a
couple of splint chairs in the cart to sit on, like a
small edition of the celebrated Florida “gondola,”
but as a rule there is no seat—to make one permanently
would be altogether too much trouble,—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the man and his family all huddle together in the
bottom of the jolting box.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i-288.jpg" width="312" height="227" alt="man and wife in wagon pulled by ox" />
<div class="caption">A MOUNTAIN CONVEYANCE.</div>
</div>

<p>Until lately these mountain people made nearly all
the clothes they wore. They had hand-looms which
they built themselves, and it was the occupation of
the women at all spare moments to spin the flax or
the wool, to dye the yarn and weave the cloth.
These looms are just the same rough picturesque old
machines that used to be seen all over the country
before the Revolution, but which now exist only in
some out of the way corners, like this Blue Ridge
region. Before the year’s weaving begins the whole
house presents a gay appearance, for from every peg
and place where they can be hung depend brightly
colored hanks of yarn ready for the loom.</p>

<p>The ordinary dress of the men now is this tough
homespun dyed butternut color; nearly all the bed-linen
and under-clothing, also, of the mountain people,
is still made by them. But the women’s calico
dresses are bought at the village store and made after
very wonderful patterns. The only head dress is the
universal Shaker sun-bonnet. On Sundays, however,
if some travelling preacher happens along and holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
service in the tumble down meeting-house at the four
corners, you will see black store clothes of ancient
make, while the gayest of ribbons and flaunting
feathers bedeck the red-cheeked and happy-hearted
lassies. But this happens only once in four weeks
or so, for the neighborhoods are too thinly settled and
poor to support a steady minister.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 163px;">
<img src="images/i-290.jpg" width="163" height="243" alt="woman in apron" />
<div class="caption">A MOUNTAIN LASS.</div>
</div>

<p>Though so far behind the times in all that seems
civilized and comfortable, though so ignorant of what
is going on in the great
world outside of their
blue, beautiful mountains,
and so utterly unlearned,
these mountain
people are warm-hearted,
generous,
independent in thought
and faithful to a friend.
They know that they
are strong of frame,
and have a profound
contempt for those
who live outside in the lowlands, even for those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
live anywhere in towns, of the ways of which they
know and care nothing at all. What is a man
good for, they wonder, who can’t ride a wild
colt, or follow easily the trail of a wolf, or even
track a bee to its tree? Even the women regard
the men of the lower country as effeminate. A hunting
party from South Carolina were up at Mt. Jonah
one day, when they found themselves being greatly
laughed at by a young woman there, who proposed
to take the largest of them on her shoulders and then
run a foot-race; she said she could beat them all, thus
weighted. On another occasion this same girl was
seen coming out of a gorge with a rifle in her hand,
her sleeves rolled up and her arms covered with
blood. Upon being questioned she carelessly replied
that she’d “killed a bar jest beyant the Terapin!”</p>

<p>Their ignorance of town ways has been the source
of much amusement to city people when occasionally
some of the mountain folks stray down to Atlanta
or Greenville. There never were any rustics so rural,
I believe. It is laughable merely to look at
them. What would excite our respect for its strength
and honesty on some wild hill-top, only makes them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
doubly ridiculous in the city’s strange streets. A
good story has come down from the old days before
railroads, on this point.</p>

<p>A large party of “Hard-shell Baptists” from the
Blue Ridge went down to Augusta, in wagons, one
August, to buy supplies. While there, one of the
brethren lost his head through drinking a glass of
brandy which had been mixed with ice and sugar
until it was very delicious. On his return home he
was dealt with by the church. He freely acknowledged
the fault, but said that he had been deceived
by the “sweetnin’.” The church council thereupon
forgave him easily the wrong of being drunk, but expelled
him for the lie he told about having <i>ice</i> in his
tumbler, in midsummer, when everybody knew it was
colder upon the mountains than down at Augusta, yet
there was no ice!</p>

<p>But little by little this old, charmingly ignorant and
simple mountain people, are being modernized by the
running of railways past, if not through, their mountains,
and the increased number of visitors that go to
see their bold crags and lovely valleys. The old men
and women still cling to their old ways. “’Pars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
like ’twould take a power to change me,” one dear
old lady said to me. But the boys and girls are getting
more “peart,” are anxious to learn and see, and
are not afraid of a little change. When the Piedmont
Air Line proposed to put a branch back into the
hills toward the gold diggings around Dahlonega, I
heard a mountain family discussing it. The daughter
and pride of the household, a gushing damsel of
seventeen, put in her opinion:</p>

<p>“Uncle Jim saays if he was to see one of them
railroads a cummin’ he’d leave the world and take a
saplin’. Dad saays he’d just lie right down flat on
the yearth. But I want ’em to come. I’d just set
right down on a basket of cohn turned ovah, and
clap my hands. I ain’t afraid.”</p>

<p>Then she caught me making a note, as she thought,
and instantly begged me to stop.</p>

<p>“Some of these yere folks are right foolish,” she
said, half ashamed, “and maybe you’ll make a heap
of fun outen ’em; but you must brush ’em up a
powerful lot. You musn’t give ’em too much of their
nat’l appearance.”</p>

<p>Well, I hope I haven’t!</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOY_KING_OF_EGYPT" id="THE_BOY_KING_OF_EGYPT">THE BOY KING OF EGYPT.</a></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">YOU have all heard of Rameses the Great, whose
noble presence looms up from the black night
of ages, majestic, gracious, clear cut, and real almost
as the monarchs of to-day.</p>

<p>Rameses mei Amoun, as his people delighted to
call him, meaning Rameses beloved of Ammon,
the great god of Egypt, was born more than three
thousand years ago, in Thebes, the capital of the
kingdom. His father was a pharaoh, Seti I., and
his mother was the queen Livea. Old Greek historians
tell marvellous stories concerning his birth.
They claim that one of the gods announced to Seti
in a dream that the tiny babe should become the
sovereign of the whole earth. It is clear that the
ambition of the father prompted him to do all in his
power to secure the fulfilment of this prophecy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>With a royal liberality, he ordered that all of the
male children of the realm born on the same day
with the crown prince should be brought to the
palace. Here nurses were provided, and they were
reared with and educated like the young prince in all
respects. The king believed that a company of fellow
students and playmates from childhood would
be bound to him in manhood by the ties of affection,
the best and strongest of all. They were “skilled in
all the learning of the Egyptians,” and also trained
to feats of bodily skill, strength and endurance. Thus
they grew up a brave company of hardy young warriors,
well fitted to obey and to command.</p>

<p>The stone pictures of Rameses on the monuments
show that he was regarded as a king even in infancy,
and received the homage of the people in his cradle.
There are sculptures of him as a mere infant, with
the finger to the mouth, and yet wearing the “pshent,”
or double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Others
are in child’s dress and with the braided sidelock of
hair, but having the Uræus, or Asp, the symbol of
royalty, above his head. These may be seen at the
museum of the Louvre in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>The inscriptions give us an address of his subjects
to him after he had succeeded to the throne: “When
you were yet a very little child, wearing the braided
hair, no monument was made without you. You commanded
armies when you were ten years old.”</p>

<p>Seti, his father, died when he was but fifteen years
old, and after the customary seventy days of mourning
for the king had passed and his splendid tomb
was sacredly sealed, Rameses II. became the boy king
of the mighty land of the Nile.</p>

<p>The first public acts of his reign show a knowledge
of human nature beyond his years. He appointed
his young companions the generals of his armies; he
distributed among them lands and large gifts, and by
every means sought to strengthen the bands of their
loyalty to himself. For the people at large he forgave
all fines and penalties, and opened the doors of
all the crowded prisons. In this way he secured the
loving faithfulness of his subjects at home, and of the
great armies he was to lead in long victorious marches
through an enemy’s country. Does it not read like a
romance, that some of his boldest expeditions and
bravest conquests were accomplished while he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
still under twenty years of age? Is he not a veritable
boy king? Herodotus tells us that after Ethiopia
and all the nations of Asia were subdued, he passed
into Europe and conquered a few wild tribes of barbarians.
After each victory he erected <i>stelæ</i>, or
tablets, inscribed with his name and that of his country.
Herodotus saw three of these tablets, and they
have been found by travellers in our day. Two of
them are in Palestine. Each is the figure colossal of
a warrior, carved on a solid wall of rock, standing
with spear in one hand and bow in the other. On
the breast is the inscription, “It is I who have conquered
this country by the strength of my arm.” All
of his victories are also recorded on the stone walls
of temples, with marvellous detail. The painted
sculpture shows the wealth of tribute he exacted:
gold, ivory, ebony, and timber for building his ships
of war, the droves of dusky captives running before
his royal chariot, and the gods bestowing honors and
blessing on their well-beloved son. No monarch of
earth has left a more imperishable record on the
pages of history than Rameses the Great. He was
the Sesostris of the Greeks, their greatest hero. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
was the pharaoh whose reign was the golden age of
power and splendor in Egypt. He was one of the
long line who so cruelly oppressed the Israelites.
Many of the magnificent monuments of his reign
were builded entirely by subjugated peoples who were
prisoners of war. This fact is carefully noted on
tablets, and among them the “bricks without straw”
of the captive Hebrews are largely represented. He
is said to be the father of the princess who found the
Jewish infant in his frail cradle of reeds. If this be
true it was at his imperial court that Moses became
“skilled in all the learning of the Egyptians.” The
splendid achievements of his reign attest their wonderful
knowledge of the arts and sciences.</p>

<p>On a <i>stelæ</i>, or tablet, deciphered jointly by distinguished
English and French orientalists, is a detailed
account of the boring of an artesian well by the
special decree of Rameses. An embassage, consisting
of the chief dignitaries of a distant province, arrived
at the court and begged an audience with the king.
They petitioned for a spring to supply water to the
slaves and animals employed in bringing gold from
a far region over a parched desert road, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
they said were dying of thirst on the long journey.
His majesty graciously had compassion on these
his humble subjects, and in obedience to his royal
mandate, water rose to the height of twenty feet on
the road to Okan. The exact height was decreed by
his own lips, and the dry and thirsty land was refreshed.
The great canal from the Nile to the Red
Sea—one of the triumphant successes of our own
century—was first accomplished by the engineers of
Rameses mei Amoun. The great temple palaces of
Luxor and Karnak, the wonderful rock-hewn temples
at Aboo Simbel and the Rameseum—or Memnonium,
as it has been wrongly called—are among the
stupendous monuments of his reign, the latter being
his splendid tomb. Its walls are covered with painted
sculptures telling the wonders of his life. Chief
among these is an episode in one of his battles with
the Khetas, a powerful enemy, which commemorates
the great personal bravery of the king. It is a favorite
subject of the sculptures of his time. It is
twice given in the Rameseum and appears again three
times in the principal temples that perpetuate the
glories of his long reign of sixty-eight years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>He is represented in his chariot, furiously driven
by his master of the horse into the midst of the
foe, and although surrounded by the archers of the
hostile ranks, he is dealing death with each arrow that
flies from his strong bow, while he seems to bear a
charmed life. The picture story of this dashing,
reckless courage is curiously confirmed by a papyrus
or Egyptian book in the British museum. This is an
historical poem commemorating the battle, and written
at the time by a court poet named Penta-ur. It
was held in high honor by his countrymen, and was
deemed worthy of a place on one of the walls of the
temple palace of Karnak, where it is graven entire.
It says, “Six times the king pierced his way into the
army of the vile Khetas, six times did he enter
their midst.... When my master of horse saw that
I remained surrounded by many chariots he faltered
and his heart gave way for fear; a mighty terror
seized his limbs, and he cried, ‘My good master,
generous king, halt in thy course and let us save the
breath of our lives. What can we do, O Rameses
mei Amoun, my good master?’ And thus did his
majesty reply: ‘Have courage! strengthen thy heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
oh my comrade!... Ammon would not be a god
did he not make glorious my countenance in the presence
of the countless legions of the foe.’”</p>

<p>The portrait statues of Rameses are innumerable,
from the delicately carved statuette to the huge fragments
of the Colossus of the Rameseum, which was
thirteen yards in height. It would seem that his
majestic figure and gracious face can never be forgotten
by the race of men.</p>

<p>There are sphinxes of rose-colored granite with the
body of a lion and the noble head of Rameses. This
combination, so familiar in Egypt, typified the union
of physical and intellectual strength by the lion and the
man. The far-famed sitting statues in front of the
“Speos,” or excavated rock temple at Aboo Simbel,
are the most tremendous of these portraits. Nothing
even in Egypt compares with these stone giants for
grandeur and power. Their measureless, voiceless,
eternal strength oppresses the beholder with a sense
of utter insignificance in their mighty presence. In
the great halls which pierce the solid mass of the
mountain, gigantic standing figures, with folded arms
and the calm, placid face of Rameses, seem to uphold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the everlasting hills. In another temple he is found
seated between two of the gods of the land as their
equal in the triad. In the rock temples of Aboo Simbel
we find one of those strangely beautiful “touches
of nature” that “make the world akin.” By the
side of the greater one, guarded by its gigantic
wardens, there is another and smaller one, called
the “Speos of Athor,” the goddess of love and
beauty, and the “Grotto of Purity.” It was built
by Rameses for the sole use of his royal wife, called
“Nofre-ari,” “the good companion.” The other
temples of the country preserve the records of many
kings. The one at Aboo Simbel is sacred to the glory
and greatness of Rameses mei Amoun. It is by this
one, then, that he builded the chapel for his queen.
On the wonderful front wall of the Portico are portrait
statues of the royal lady and her children, and
over them the legend, “Rameses, to the royal spouse,
Nofre-ari, whom <i>he loved</i>.” The adamantine stone
has safely brought down to us the tender grace of
this dedication.</p>

<p>Travellers tell us that every detail of ornament
in the grottoes, the pillars and their flower-like capitals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the sculpture and frescoes, are all in some way connected
with the beloved wife. As a token of her
grateful recognition of this knightly devotion, there is
on the inner wall of the chapel, after the cartouche of
Rameses, this answering legend: “His royal spouse,
who loves him, Nofre-ari, the great mother, has constructed
this resting-place in the grotto of purity.”
Ampère, a French traveller, tells us this in his letters
from Egypt, and adds, “The queen is charming, and
no one wearies of meeting her likeness everywhere, and
which Pharaoh never wearies of repeating.” Are not
they beautiful, these records of an imperishable love?
They cause the dim dusky ages that separate us from
the time of Rameses to vanish, and we seem to feel
the heart-throbs of the man beneath the strange royal
robes of the Egyptian king.</p>

<p>In the great ruin of the Rameseum, which a French
scholar calls “an historical museum” of the reign
of Rameses, near the colossus of himself was one
nearly as large of his mother, Livea, with a triple
crown, showing that she was the daughter, wife and
mother of a king. In the same place were two statues
of his mother and daughter, bequeathed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
world together, as they were associated in the love of
the pharaoh.</p>

<p>In another temple, where huge caryatides of himself
supported the pylon or entrance tower, were the
statues of his fourteen daughters. Their names have
come down to us, but do not sound very musical to
our modern ears. By their crowns we know that five
of them became queens. In all of the sculptures of
his battles and marches, he is accompanied by some
of his twenty-three sons. Their names are given, and
they are known as princes by the royal dress, and by
the braided and jewelled lock of hair which they
wore during the lifetime of the king their father.
By all of these touching records of the home affections
we know that the wonderful baby king and boy warrior
was in his manhood a tender, loving son, husband
and father; and this knowledge adds a purer, brighter
lustre even to his splendid fame.</p>

<p>That he reigned sixty-eight years is a fact so
fully confirmed by data that it may be accepted
as truth. Until the death of his eldest son, Sha-em-Jom,
the crown prince, beloved by the people
and dearest to his father’s heart, the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of these long years is one undimmed by misfortune.
This occurred thirteen years before his own
death.</p>

<p>From this time the monuments give only hints of
the frequent deaths of his children and of the feebleness
and blindness of his last years. But it is not
strange that, after eighty years of his stirring life as
king and conqueror, the common lot of all should
overtake even the great Rameses.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant finish to the old story to know that
one daughter of his winter years comforted him with
tender, filial love till the last of earth, and he went
to his magnificent completed tomb full of years and
honors. No mortal ever reached a dizzier height of
fame. After more than three thousand years, in a
far land unknown to his time and among a race then
undreamed of, his placid, majestic face is familiar to
every student. One of our most ambitious young
artists could find no worthier subject for his canvas,
in the last salon, than a portrait of Rameses
II. Very recently I saw in our “fair city by the
sea,” the Thebes of our country, a magnificent
mansion, the library of which was an old Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
hall reproduced. It abounded in lotus flowers,
obelisks, sphinxes, winged globes and sacred bulls.
Over the warm-hued mantel, like the red porphyry of
the Nile country, was a richly framed portrait of heroic
size. The gracious face, so calm and strong, the
straight features, dark beard and royal head-dress of
Egypt, proclaimed a strange fact. Rameses the
Great, patron of libraries and learning 1400 B. C., is
chosen as the guardian genius of a library in our
young western capital after three thousand two hundred
and seventy-seven years.</p>

<p>I must stop before you all grow gray and wrinkled
with groping so far back through the long night of
ages past. But you will not soon forget the story of
the boy king of Egypt.</p>

<h2><a name="A_CHILD_IN_FLORENCE" id="A_CHILD_IN_FLORENCE">A CHILD IN FLORENCE.</a></h2>




<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">WE lived in that same Casa Guidi from whose
windows Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s poet-eyes
saw what she afterward put into glowing verse.
Casa Guidi is a great pile of graystone, a pile of
many windows which give upon the Via Maggio and a
little piazza, as the squares in Florence are called.
Consequently it is lighter and brighter than are many
of the houses in Florence, where the streets are narrow
and the houses lofty.</p>

<p>According to almost universal custom, Casa Guidi
was divided into half a dozen different apartments,
occupied by as many families. Ours was on the second
floor, on the side of the house overlooking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
piazza on which stood the church of San Felice.
The pleasantest room in our apartment, as I thought,
was a room in which I passed many hours of an ailing
childhood; a room which I christened “The Gallery,”
because it was long and narrow, and was hung
with many cheerful pictures. It opened into a little
boudoir at one end, and into the <i>salon</i> at the other.
The walls of gallery and boudoir were frescoed gayly
with fruits and flowers and birds.</p>

<p>Here the sun streamed in all through the long,
mild, Florentine winters; here I would lie on my
couch, and count the roses on the walls, and the
birds, and the apricots, and listen to the cries in the
streets; and, if a procession went by, hurry to the
window and watch it pass, and stay at the window until
I was tired, when I would totter back to my couch,
and my day dreams, and my drawing, and my verse-making,
and my attempts at studying.</p>

<p>I was fired with artist-ambitions at the age of ten;
and what wonder, surrounded as I was by artists living
and dead, and by their immortal works. It
seemed to me then that one <i>must</i> put all one’s impressions
of sight and form into shape. But I did
not develop well. Noses proved a stumbling-block,
which I never overcame, to my attaining to eminence
in figure-sketching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The picture that I admired most in those days was
one of Judith holding up the gory head of Holofernes,
in the Pitti Gallery of Paintings. I was seized with
a longing to copy it, on my return from my first visit
to the Gallery. I seated myself, one evening, before
a sheet of drawing-paper, and I tried and tried; but
the nose of Holofernes was too much for me. All
that I could accomplish was something that resembled
an enlarged interrogation mark, and recalled Chinese
art, as illustrated on fans. I was disappointed, disgusted—but,
above all, surprised: it was my first
intimation that “to do” is not “as easy as ’tis to
know what ’twere good to do.”</p>

<p>In the midst of my futile efforts, a broad-shouldered,
bearded man was announced, who having shaken
hands with the grown-ups, came and seated himself
beside the little girl, and her paint-box and pencils
and care-worn face.</p>

<p>“O Mr. Hart,” I cried, “do make this nose for me!”</p>

<p>Whereupon he made it, giving me many valuable
suggestions, meanwhile, as to the effect produced by
judicious shading. Still, I was discouraged. It was
borne in upon me that this was not <i>my</i> branch
of art.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hart,” I said, “I think I would like to make
noses <i>your</i> way.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-310.jpg" width="600" height="381" alt="palace" />
<div class="caption">PALACE IN FLORENCE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would you? Then you shall. Come to my
studio to-morrow, and you shall have some clay and a
board, and try what you can do.”</p>

<p>So the next day I insisted upon availing myself of
this invitation. Mr. Hart was then elaborating his
machine for taking portraits in marble, in his studio
in the upper part of the city. He had always several
busts on hand, excellent likenesses. His workmen
would be employed in cutting out the marble, while
he molded his original thought out of the plastic clay.
There has always been a fascination to me in statuary.
Mr. Ruskin tells us that form appealed to the old
Greeks more forcibly than color. That was in the
youth of the race; possibly, the first stage of art-development
is an appreciation of form; in my case,
I have not passed into the maturer stage yet. The
rounded proportions, curves, and reality of a statue
appeal to me as no painting ever did.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I made no greater progress in molding
than in sketching. I made my hands very sticky;
I used up several pounds of clay; then I relinquished
my hopes of becoming a sculptor. I found it more
to my taste to follow Mr. Hart around the rooms, to
chatter with the workmen, to ask innumerable questions
about the “Invention.”</p>

<p>It has been suggested that it was to this invention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of Mr. Hart’s that Mrs. Browning referred when she
wrote of—</p>

<div class="center">
“Just a shadow on a wall,”<br />
</div>

<p class="unindent">from which could be taken—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">“The measure of a man,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Which is the measure of an angel, saith</div>
<div class="verse">The apostle.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. Hart wore the apron and the cap that sculptors
affect, as a protection from the fine, white dust that
the marble sheds: generally, too, an ancient dressing-gown.
Costumes in Bohemia, the native land of
artists, are apt to be unconventional.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">
<img src="images/i-314.jpg" width="444" height="347" alt="looking at a sculpture" />
<div class="caption">MICHAEL ANGELO.</div>
</div>

<p>It was a most wondrous thing to me to watch the
brown clay take shapes and beauty under the sculptor’s
touch. I can still see him fashioning a wreath
of grape-leaves round a Bacchante’s head; the leaves
would grow beneath his hand, in all the details of
tendrils, stems, veinings. It seemed to me he must
be so happy, to live in this world of his own creating.
I hope that he was happy, the kindly man; he had the
patience and the enthusiasm of the genuine artist,—a
patience that had enabled him to surmount serious
obstacles before he reached his present position.
Like Powers and Rheinhart, he began life as a stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
cutter. I wonder what dreams of beauty those three
men saw imprisoned in the unhewn stone, to which
they longed to give shape, before Fate smiled on
them, and put them in the way of doing the best that
in them lay!</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that neither Painting nor Sculpture
proved propitious, a great reverence and love of
Art was born in me at this time. Possibly a love and
reverence all the more intense, because Art became
to me, individually, an unattainable thing. I remember
passing many hours, at this period, in what would
certainly have been durance vile, had I not been fired
with a lofty ambition. Mr. Edwin White was sketching
in a picture which called for two figures—an old
man and a child. The old man was easily obtained,
a beautiful professional model of advanced years;
but the child was not so readily found. I was filled
with secret joy when it was suggested to me that <i>I</i>
should be the required model. I was enchanted when
the permission was given me to perform this important
service. This was before the time of the long
illness to which I referred in the beginning of this
paper. The spending every morning for a week or so
in Mr. White’s studio implied the being excused
from French verbs and Italian translations. What a
happy life, I thought, to be a model! I envied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
beautiful old patriarch with whom I was associated in
this picture. Kneeling beside him, as I was instructed
to do, I thought what bliss it would be to be
associated with him always, and to go about with him
from studio to studio, posing for pictures.</p>

<p>There must be an inspiration for artists in the very
air of Florence. The beautiful city is filled with
memorials of the past, painted and carved by the
masters passed away. I suppose that artists are
constantly aroused to the wish to do great things by
the sight of what these others have accomplished.
Then, too, the history of the past, the religion of the
past, are such realities in Florence. The artist feels
called upon to interpret them, not as dead fancies,
but as facts. The mythology of the Greeks and
Romans meets one at every turn. I, for one, was
as intimately acquainted with the family history of
Venus, of Ceres, of Pallas, of Persephone, as with
that of Queen Elizabeth, of Catherine de Medici, of
Henrietta Maria. Nay, I was more intimate with the
delightful elder set.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i-318.jpg" width="340" height="413" alt="older man on chair, child kneeling beside him" />
<div class="caption">POSING</div>
</div>

<p>The heathen gods reigned sylvanly in the Boboli
Gardens, and it was there that I formed a most intimate
personal acquaintance with them. The Boboli
Gardens are the gardens of the Pitti Palace, an immense,
unlovely pile, the memorial of the ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of the Marquis Pitti, who reared it. He had vowed
that he would build a palace large enough to hold in
its court-yard the palace of his hated rival, the Marquis
Strozzi. He was as good as his word; but in carrying
out his designs he ruined his fortune. The vast
palace, when completed, passed out of his hands into
those of the Medici, then the Dukes of Florence.
Afterwards it became the residence of the foreign
rulers of Florence. When I remember the city,
Austrian soldiers guarded the great gateway of the
Pitti, and marched up and down the court-yards;
and the showy white uniforms of Austrian officers
were conspicuous in the ante-chambers and guard-rooms.</p>

<p>But behind the great palace, the fair Boboli Gardens
spread away. There was a statue of Ceres
crowning a terrace, up to which climbed other terraces—an
amphitheatre of terraces, in truth, from a fish-pond
in the centre—which commanded the city
through which the Arno flowed. Many a sunny day
have we children—my sisters and I—sat at the
base of this statue and gossiped about Ceres, beautiful
Mother Nature, and her daughter, who was
stolen from her by the Dark King. Further down,
on a lower slope, was a statue of Pallas, with her
calm, resolute face, her helmet, her spear, her owl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
I remember that Millie and Eva and I were especially
fond of this Pallas. I used to wonder why it was
that men should ever have been votaries of Venus
rather than of her. I have ceased to wonder at this,
since then; but in those days I especially criticized
a statue of Venus, after the well-known Venus of
Canova, which impressed me as insipid. This statue
stood hard by the severe majesty of Pallas, white
against a background of oleanders and laurestines.</p>

<p>Then there was a second fish-pond, in the centre
of which was an orange-island, about which tritons
and mermen and mermaids were disposed. I can see
their good-humored, gay—nay, some of them were
even <i>leering</i>—faces, still. Soulless creatures these,
we were well aware, and so were sorry for them.
The immortal gods, of course, we credited with souls;
but these—with the wood-nymphs, and bacchantes,
and satyrs, that we were apt to come upon all through
the garden,—these we classed as only on a level a
trifle higher than that of the trees, and brooks, into
which some of them had been transformed in the
course of the vicissitudes of their careers.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is because the spirit of the old religion
so took possession of me in that Italian garden, that
to this day the woods, and the dells, and the rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
seem to me to be the embodied forms of living creatures.
A Daphne waves her arms from the laurel-tree;
a Clytie forever turns to her sun-lover, in the
sunflower.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE two public picture galleries of Florence—the
Pitti and the Uffizi—are on either side of
the Arno. They are connected by a covered way,
which runs along over the roofs of houses, and crosses
the jewelers’ bridge, so called because upon it are
built the shops of all the jewelers in town,—or so it
would seem at first sight. At all events, here are
nothing but jewelers’ shops; small shops, such as I
imagine the shops of the middle ages to have been.
But in the narrow windows, and in the unostentatious
show-cases, are displayed most exquisite workmanship
in Florentine mosaic, in turquoise, in malakite, exquisite
as to the quality of the mosaic and the character
of the designs in which the earrings, brooches,
bracelets, were made up. As a rule, however, the gold-work
was inferior, and the settings were very apt to
come apart, and the pins to break and bend, after a
very short wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Sauntering across this bridge, one passes, on his
way to the Uffizi, various shops in narrow streets,
where the silks of Florentine manufacture are displayed.
Such pretty silks, dear girls, and so cheap!
For a mere song you may go dressed like the butterflies,
in Florence, clad in bright, sheeny raiment, spun
by native worms out of native mulberry leaves.
Equally cheap are the cameos, and the coral, that are
brought here from neighboring Naples, and the turquoises,
imported directly from the Eastern market,
and the mosaics, inlaid of precious stones in Florence
herself.</p>

<p>So we come out upon the Piazza, or Square, of the
Uffizi. The Uffizi Palace itself is of irregular form,
and inclosed by <i>loggiae</i>, or covered colonnades. In
front of the palace stands the David of Michael
Angelo, in its strong beauty. Michael Angelo said of
this that “the only test for a statue is the light of a
public square.” To this test the David has been
subjected for over three hundred years, and still, in
the searching light of day, stand revealed the courage
and the faith and the strength of the young man who
went forth to do battle with the giant, “In the name
of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of
Israel.” And who shall say to how many of us
Michael Angelo does not preach, across the centuries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
a sermon in stone, as we stand before his David?—as
we recall what Giants of Doubt, of Passion, of
Pride, we, too, are called upon to battle with in our
day?</p>

<p>In a square portico, or <i>loggia</i>, giving upon the
Piazza, is a statue of Perseus, another slayer of monsters,
or, rather, a slayer of monsters in another
realm. It was this Perseus to whom Pallas gave a
mirror-shield of burnished brass, whom Mercury armed
with an adamantine scythe, giving him also wings on
his feet. It was this Perseus who slew the Gorgon
Princess Medusa. In the statue, the fatal head of
Medusa, with its stony stare, is held aloft by the warrior,
who is trampling upon the headless trunk. This
head had, in death as in life, the power of turning
many men to stone, and was thus made use of by
Perseus against other enemies of his. The subject
of the stony-eyed Gorgon possessed, apparently, a
curious fascination for artists. There is a famous
head painted on wood by Leonardo da Vinci, besides
this statue by Benvenuto Cellini, in the Uffizi.</p>

<p>How, as a child, I used to puzzle over the strange
fable in both statue and picture! But, since then,
I have had experience of Gorgon natures in real life;
natures that chilled and repressed, stupefied all with
whom they came in contact; and I wonder less at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
fable, and I pass the word on to you, that you may
know, when unsympathetic surroundings chill your
heart and blunt your feelings, and subdue your better
self, that you are being haunted by Da Vinci’s very
Medusa, by Gellini’s very Medusa, snaky locks, fixed
eyes, impassive deadness.</p>

<p>Into the great Uffizi Palace: up the wide marble
stairway, into the long gallery that opens into the immense
suite of rooms hung with pictures; the gallery
hung with pictures, too, and set with statues.</p>

<p>How I wish I could make you see with my eyes!
How I wish I could be to you something more than a
mere traveler, telling what <i>I</i> have seen! That long
corridor, windows on one side, statues and pictures on
the other, always seems to me like a nursery for love
of art. At the far end are the quaint pictures of
Giotto and Cimabue. Then the reverent, religious
paintings of Fra Angelico. Oh, those sweet-faced,
golden-haired angels! Oh, the glimpse into the land
seen by faith, inhabited by shining ones! Oh, the
radiance of those pictures! The gold back-grounds,
the bright faces, the happy effect of them! The artists
<i>believed</i> them with all their souls, as Ruskin has
said; so they painted pictures which recall the refrain
of Bernard de Cluny’s Rhyme of the Celestial Country.
Presently pictures by Perugino, Raphael’s master, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>—quite
at the other end of the gallery—the portrait
of Raphael, painted by himself. This picture is on
an easel, and stands apart. Are you familiar with
Raphael’s beautiful, calm, <i>young</i> face? It is a face
which has passed into a proverb for beauty and
serenity. A velvet cap is pushed off the pure brow;
the hair is long and waving; the eyes are large and
dark and abstracted. I always stood before this picture
as before a shrine.</p>

<p>All the way down the gallery are statues and busts.
There are the Roman emperors, far more familiar to me
through their counterfeit presentments than through
the pages of history. Augustus, Diocletian, Trajan:
to us girls they were studies in hair-dressing, if in
nothing else. Some of them with flowing locks, some
with close, short curls, some with hair parted in the
middle and laid in long, smooth curls, like a woman.
Of such was Heliogabulus, and of such was Vitellius.</p>

<p>One morning—soon after we came to Florence—we
started off upon a quest—through the Uffizi—Millie,
Eva and I, and our elders. The object of
our quest was no less a goddess than she called of
the Medici.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i-328.jpg" width="352" height="525" alt="RAPHAEL" />
</div>

<p>I remember that we wandered down the long gallery
I have described, and through room after room. It
was the fancy of our mamma, and the uncle who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
taking care of us all, to find their way about for themselves.
For instance: if we had been told that a
certain picture, by a certain master, was to be found
in a certain palace, we roamed in and out around the
other pictures until <i>the</i> picture <i>revealed itself</i> to us. It
was surprising how seldom we were deceived in this
method of ours. We would pass by dozens of pictures
by inferior artists, completely unmoved; then,
suddenly, a thrilling vision of beauty would glow upon
us, and we would acknowledge ourselves to be in a
royal presence-chamber.</p>

<p>Such a presence-chamber is the Tribune in the
Uffizi palace. We came upon many marble Venuses
before we arrived in this Tribune, a large, octagon
room, with a domed ceiling, blue, flecked with gold
stars; but we passed them all by—until finally we
entered the reverent stillness which is kept about the
Venus of Venuses. We recognized her at once.
There she stood, in that silent room, the light subdued
to a judicious mellowness—beautiful with the fresh,
smiling beauty of perpetual youth; beautiful with the
same beauty that gladdened the heart of the Greek
artist who carved her, hundreds of years ago; so
many hundreds of years that the marble has in consequence,
the rich cream-color of old ivory.</p>

<p>In this same Tribune hangs the portrait of a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
young woman, called the Fornarina. Of her only
this is known, that she was the beloved of Raphael,
and that she was the daughter of a baker in Rome.
Fornarina means little bakeress, or, perhaps <i>we</i>
should say, baker-girl. But <i>this</i> Fornarina might be
a princess. An “ox-eyed Juno” princess, dark and
glowing, with a serene composure about her that one
remembers as her most striking characteristic.</p>

<p>Raphael’s lady-love. Millie and I knew more
about her than was ever written in books. Not reliable
gossip—gossip of our own invention, but gossip
that delighted our hearts.</p>

<p>Other pictures by Raphael hang here, too. How
distinctly I recall them. How vivid are all the works
of this great painter! The critics say that one who
excelled in so many things, excelled also in <i>expression</i>.
Yes. It is this which gives to his pictures the distinctness
of photographs from life. They are dramatic.
They take you at once into the spirit of the
scene represented. They are full of soul, and herein
lies the great difference between Raphael’s works and
those of other schools, the Venetian, for instance.
The painters of Venice aimed at effects of color;
Raphael used color only in order to express a loftier
thought.</p>

<p>Are you tired of the Uffizi? Come with me, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
few minutes, before we go, into the Hall of Niobe.
Words fail me to relate with what mingled emotions
of sympathy, distress and delight we children used to
haunt this hall, and examine each sculptured form in
turn. The story goes that Niobe incurred the displeasure
of Diana and Apollo, who wreaked their
vengeance upon the mother by killing her fourteen
children. At the head of the hall stands Niobe, convulsed
with grief, vainly imploring the angry brother
and sister to show compassion, and at the same time
protecting the youngest child, who is clinging to her.
But we feel that both intercession and protection will
be in vain. On the other side of the hall are her sons
and daughters. Some already pierced with arrows,
stiff in death; some in the attitude of flight, some
staggering to the ground. It is an easy matter for the
imagination to picture the supreme moment when, bereft
of all her children, the mother’s heart breaks, and
she is turned to stone. The legend relates that that
stone wept tears. Nor was it a difficult matter for
me to take this on faith. What is more, many is the
time I have planted myself before the very marble
Niobe in the Uffizi, firmly expecting to see the tears
flow down her cheeks.</p>

<p>So we come out upon the streets of Florence again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Fair Florence, the narrow Arno dividing her, the purple
Appennines shutting her in the Arno’s fertile
valley. Flower-women stop us on the streets, and
offer us flowers.
Flower-women
who
are not as
pretty as they
are wont to be
at fancy-dress
parties; they
are apt to be
heavy and
middle-aged,
in fact, one
of them, the
handsomest of
the band, has
a scar on her
face, and a tinge of romance attached to her name.
It is whispered about that her lover’s dagger inflicted
the scar, in a fit of jealousy. Once I myself saw a
look flash into her eyes, when something was said to
offend her by a passer-by on the street, which suggested
the idea that she might have used her dagger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
in return. It was the look of a tiger aroused. And
after that I never quite lost sight of the smothered
fire in those black eyes of hers.</p>

<p>I used to wonder why I saw so few pretty faces in
Florence. Moreover, how lovely the American ladies
always looked in contrast with the swarthy, heavy
Tuscan women. As a rule, that is. Of course, there
were plain Americans and handsome Tuscans; but
our countrywomen certainly bear off the palm for delicacy
of feature and coloring. Still, the Tuscan peasant-girls
make a fine show, with their broad flats of
Leghorn straw; and when they are married they are
invariably adorned with strings of Roman pearls about
their necks. So many rows of pearls counts for so
much worldly wealth.</p>

<p>I stroll on, stopping to look in at the picture stores,
or coming to an enraptured pause before a cellar-way
piled up with rare and fragrant flowers, such as one
sees seldom out of Florence—the City of Flowers.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>




<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE summer we lived in a villa a short distance
outside the gates of Florence. For Florence
had gates in those days, and was a walled city, kept
by Austrian sentinels. That was the time of the
Austrian occupation. Since then, Solferino and
Magenta have been fought, and the treaty of Villa-franca
has been signed, and now, “Italy’s one, from
mountain to sea!”—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“King Victor has Italy’s crown on his head,</div>
<div class="verse">And his flag takes all heaven with its white, green and red.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But then the Florentines bowed their necks under
a hated foreign yoke, scowling when they dared at a
retreating “maledetto Tedesco” (cursed German).</p>

<p>The phrase “white, green and red” recalls to me
the fire-balloons we used to send up from our villa
garden, on the summer nights of long ago. We had,
for our Italian tutor, an enthusiastic patriot, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
fought in the Italian ranks in ’48, and who was looking
forward to shouldering a musket soon again. It
afforded him intense gratification to send the national
colors floating out over Florence. Our villa was built
on a hill-side, commanding a fine view of the Val
d’Arno, and of the City of Flowers herself, domed,
campaniled, spired. The longer the voyages made
by our balloons, the higher rose the spirits of our
Signor Vicenzo. He regarded these airy nothings,
made by his own hands, of tissue paper and alcohol,
as omens of good or ill to his beloved country.</p>

<p>I suppose he was a fair type of his countrymen,
intensely dramatic, with a native facility of expression.
One notices this facility of expression among all
classes. The Italians have an eloquent sign-language
of their own, in which they are as proficient as in the
language of spoken words. It is charming to see
two neighbors communicating with each other across
the street, without uttering a syllable, by the means
of animated gestures. It seems a natural sequence
that they should be a people of artists.</p>

<p>Such long rambles as my sisters and I and our
maid Assunta took, starting from the villa! Assunta
was the daughter of a neighboring countryman of the
better sort, who cultivated a grape vineyard and an
olive field, besides keeping a dairy. We had a way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
of happening by in the evening in time for a glass of
warm milk. Assunta’s mother supplied our table
with milk and butter daily, moreover; butter made
into tiny pats and done up daintily in grape leaves,
never salted, by the way; milk put up in flasks
cased in straw, such as are also used for the native
wine. Was it the unfailing appetite of childhood, or
was that milk and butter really superior to any I have
ever tasted since? What charming breakfasts recur
to me! <i>Semele</i>, as we called our baker’s rolls; a
golden circle of butter on its own leaf; great figs
bursting with juicy sweetness; milk.</p>

<p>How good those figs used to taste for lunch, too,
when we would pay a few <i>crazis</i> for the privilege of
helping ourselves to them off the fig-trees in some
<i>podere</i> (orchard, vineyard), inclosed in its own stone
wall, on which scarlet poppies waved in the golden
sunlight, beneath the blue, blue skies. Am I waxing
descriptive and dull? Well, dear girls, I wish you
could have shared those days with me. Roaming
about those hill-sides, my sisters and I peopled them
with the creatures of our own imaginations, as well
as those of other people’s imaginations, to say nothing
of veritable historical characters. We read and
re-read Roger’s <i>Italy</i>. Do you know that enchanting
book? Can you say by heart, as Millie, Eva and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
could, “Ginevra,” and “Luigi,” and “The Brides of
Venice”? I wonder if I should like that poetry now?
I <i>loved</i> it then. Also, I date my knowledge of Byron
to that same epoch. We children devoured the descriptions
in “Childe Harold,” and absorbed “The
Two Foscari,” which otherwise we would perhaps
have never read. Byron was the poet of our fathers
and mothers; but in these early days dramatic and
narrative poetry was more intelligible than the mysticism
of Tennyson and the Brownings, so enchanting
to me now.</p>

<p>One evening, some friends who occupied a neighboring
villa invited mamma to be present at the reading
of a manuscript poem by an American poet,
Buchanan Read. I was permitted to go, too, and
was fully alive to the dignity of the occasion. Mr.
Read was making a reputation rapidly; there was no
telling what might be in store for him. The generous
hand of brother artists in Florence all cheered him
on his way, and accorded to him precisely that kind
of sympathetic encouragement which his peculiar nature
required. The group of interested, friendly
faces in the <i>salon</i> at Villa Allori rises up before me as
I write, on the evening when Mr. Read, occupying a
central position, read aloud, in his charming, trained
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember that, in the pauses of the reading, Mr.
Powers, who was present, amused one or two children
about him by drawing odd little caricatures on a stray
bit of note paper, which is, by the way, still in my
possession. Doubtless Mr. Powers’ reputation rests
upon his statues, not his caricatures; yet these particular
ones have an immense value for me, dashed
off with a twinkle in the artist’s beautiful dark eyes.</p>

<p>There was also present on this occasion a beautiful
young lady, for whom Mr. Read had just written
some birthday verses, which he read to us, after
having completed the reading of the larger manuscript.
Those birthday verses have haunted me ever
since, and this, although I cannot recall a word of
the more ambitious poem.</p>

<p>Mr. Powers had lived for so many years in Florence
that he was by right of that, if by no other right, the
patriarch of the American colony there. He and
his large family were most intensely American, in
spite of their long expatriation. His was emphatically
an American <i>home</i>, as completely so as though the
Arno and the Appenines had been, instead, the
Mississippi and the Alleghanies. This was no doubt
due to the fact that Mrs. Powers was preëminently
an American wife and mother, large-hearted and
warm-hearted. She never forgot the household traditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
of her youth. She baked mince-pies and
pumpkin-pies at Christmas and Thanksgiving, and
dispensed these bounties to her countrymen with a
lavish hand. Then, too, the Powers lived in a <i>house</i>,
and not in an <i>apartment</i>, or, as we say, on a flat.
The children ran up and down-stairs, and in and out
their own yard, which lay between the dwelling-house
and the studio, just as American children do. And
in this genial, wholesome home an artist grew up in
the second generation. A son of Mr. Powers is now
making name and fame for himself in his father’s
profession.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i-340.jpg" width="300" height="441" alt="back of group of children climbing stairs" />
<div class="caption">GOING TO THE PARTY.</div>
</div>

<p>It has been said that the beautiful face of the
eldest daughter of this family is suggested in her
father’s “Greek Slave.” I looked up to her then
with the respect which a child feels for an elder girl,
“a young lady in society.” I can appreciate now
and admire, even more than I did then, the extreme
simplicity and unconsciousness which so well accorded
with her grand, classic beauty. She was the good
fairy at a Christmas Tree Festival, to which all the
American girls and boys in Florence were bidden, on
the twenty-fifth of December. We were all presented
with most exquisitely made <i>bonbonnieres</i>, chiefly of
home manufacture. We were feasted on doughnuts
which brought tears to some of our eyes; dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
American doughnuts, that <i>might</i> have been fried in
the land of the free. We had French candy <i>ad
libitum;</i> but there was also on exhibition a pound or
so of genuine American stick candy, such as we see
by the bushel in this country, and which had been
brought over from the United States by a friend
recently arrived, at Mrs. Powers’ special request.
We examined this stick candy with patriotic enthusiasm.
We ate little bits of it, and thought it infinitely
better than our candied fruits and chocolate creams.
Doubtless this little incident here recalled will account
for the fact that I always associate peppermint stick
candy with the flag of the Union. It is an unfortunate
caprice of mind; but, nevertheless, the national
stripes always rise before me when I see these red
and white sticks.</p>

<p>I am inclined to the belief that exiles make the
best patriots. We American children stood up fiercely
for our own native land, whenever the question as to
national superiority arose between ourselves and
English, French, or Italian children,—especially the
English. With these we fought the Revolutionary
war all over again, hotly, if injudiciously. And I am
confident that we had a personal and individual sense
of superiority over them. No doubt we were endowed,
even at that early age, with the proverbial national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
conceit. Some one had told me that every American
was a sovereign, and that I was consequently a princess
in my own right. This became a conviction
with me, and greatly increased my self-importance.
How glorious to be the citizen of a country of such
magnificent gifts of citizenship!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 595px;">
<img src="images/i-344.jpg" width="595" height="308" alt="three women with children at party" />
<div class="caption">AT THE PARTY.</div>
</div>

<p>But to return to Mr. Powers. His statue of California
was on exhibition at this time. This is, to my
mind, the most noble and impressive of his works.
The strong, resolute face, of classic outlines, and of
the sterner type of beauty, bears a distinct resemblance
to the sculptor’s second daughter, although
by no means a portrait. It has been told me
that one of the fathers of our American church,
traveling in Italy, suggested an important alteration
in this statue. California originally carried in her
hand a bar, supposed to represent a bar of solid gold.
The idea occurred to the bishop that were this
smooth bar—which might mean anything—made
to represent a nugget of gold in the rough, the point
of the story would be far more effectively told; and
on this idea the bishop spoke. The sculptor was
impressed directly, and with all the unaffected simplicity
of real genius he thanked his critic for the
hint. California now displays her symbolic nugget;
and, moreover, about her head is designed a fillet of
bits of ore in the rough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The America of Powers is another impressive and
beautiful female form. A vision of the sculptor comes
before my eyes, standing in front of this statue, and
talking it over with a party of visitors. Such a beautiful,
simple-mannered man—with his mild dark eyes
and serene face! He wore the usual blouse and
linen apron, and the cap of the sculptor. He held his
chisel in his hand as he conversed. Some of his
audience did not agree with him in the peculiar political
views he held. But Mr. Powers would not argue,
and what need? Had he not preached his sermon in
stone, and eloquently?</p>

<h2><a name="CHEERFUL_WORDSB" id="CHEERFUL_WORDSB"></a>CHEERFUL WORDS.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In the whole range of English literature we can call to
mind the works of no single author to which the title,
“Cheerful Words,” can more properly apply than to those of
George Macdonald. It exactly expresses the element which
permeates everything from his pen, whether sermon, essay,
story or poem—an element which strengthens while it
cheers, which instills new light and life into the doubting or
discouraged soul, and incites it to fresh effort.</p>

<p>In the volume before us the editor has brought together,
with a careful and judicious hand, some of the choicest passages
from Macdonald’s works, written in various keys and
upon various subjects, but all marked by healthy sentiment
and sunshiny feeling. In quoting what a late critic has said
of the “electrical consciousness” which characterizes his
writings, the editor remarks: “The breadth and manliness
of tone and sentiment, the deep perceptions of human
nature, the originality, fancy and pathos, the fresh, out-of-door
atmosphere everywhere apparent; above all, the earnest,
wholesome, but always unobtrusive religious teaching that
underlies all his writings, give to the works of George Macdonald
a certain magnetic power that is indescribable.”
And in the selections here made that power is singularly apparent.
By turns they touch the heart, fire the imagination,
moisten the eyes, arouse the sympathies, and bring into
active exercise the better feelings and instincts of mind and
heart.</p>

<p>The introduction to the volume is from the pen of James
T. Fields, a personal friend and ardent admirer of the author.
He regards Macdonald as a master of his art, and
believes in holding up for admiration those like him, who
have borne witness to the eternal beauty and cheerful capabilities
of the universe around us, and who are lovingly
reminding us, whenever they write, of the “holiness of helpfulness.”</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
